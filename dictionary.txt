i think it was, but then again i'd be shocked if john couldn't give it instructions from thunderbird 5. huh, i hadn't really thought of how much of a deus ex machina the new thunderbird 2 can be.

that'll take some thinking.sorry, folks, this was up a tad late (i know you brits have had the episode up for a while now). still getting into the swing of posting this stuff.apple doesn't make any devices over 64gb anymore. 

i think all op really wants is a huge-storage mp3 player. no flashy touch screen, no apps, just plays music and holds a lot of songs. why exactly are you here?valve basically set the bar when it came to story expose in games during the late 90's, then again in 04. nowadays, they aren't much better than the games that came after them, but compared to the ones that came before them, it's night and day.to be fair, watch any roller derby bout and you'll see most of the women wearing equally tight shorts. plus armor would restrict movement of the thighs, etc etc etc...

then again, this is a comic movie and they could have done whatever the hell they wanted to with her design, range of movement be damned.oof.majority?go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist. it's impossible to get a useful diagnosis out of random people you've met on the internet, and it'll probably be more harm than good.

artificial fucking intelligence.

you idiots have no idea what the fuck you are talking about. stephen hawking has no idea what the fuck he is talking about. elon musk has no idea what the fuck he is talking about.

and no, it's not a question of "computing power". we literally don't have a strong enough grasp on the math to make this work assuming we had all of the compute power in the world. hooray!

and i like "30 minutes after noon", but just not as much as other episodes. 1) least favorite is thunderbird 4. not because i think it sucks (i love it!) but compared to the other four, it's the least interesting to me.

2) favorite: virgil! he's a mechanic and heavy equipment operator, plus an artist (according to the expanded lore i've read). the tab version of him is also great with his exoskeleton and fab lab in pod 2.

least favorite: uh... i *guess* lady penelope? again, not because i dislike her as a character or anything, but largely because i was always more interested in the rescues and not the espionage. her episodes were always least interesting to me for that reason, though i was fine with her in rescue-centric episodes. 

3) favorite: from the original series, probably "the mighty atom" (i'm a huge nuclear energy buff, and it's a fairly accurate episode all things considered). from the new series, so far it's been "crosscut" (though i was disappointed by the new anti-nuclear attitude).

least favorite: "30 minutes after noon", "the man from mi.5", and "space race" from the new series. i'm here for the thunderbirds, dammit, not espionage stuff! 

again, not because they're bad episodes. i just prefer the rescue and tech heavy episodes.

4) favorite: i suck, i've only seen the 2004 film. so i'll abstain from answering for favorite until i actually watch thunderbirds are go and thunderbird 6.

least favorite: 2004 film, duh. though the title sequence was pretty cool. also bill paxton. but the plot was horrendous, and too much effort was made to make it a copy-paste "disney kid film".

5) ooh yes. it doesn't usurp the original series as my favorite, but it's very obvious that the creators of thunderbirds are go have been making a phenomenal attempt at recreating the spirit of the original series. the focus is on rescues, not inter-character conflict, which is really what sunk the 2004 film.

also, looking at the cinematography and physical models... *wow*. just seeing dirt fall off of rubble gives me huge bursts of nostalgia, and the tilt-shift effect used to make the characters look in scale is pretty clever.well that would be assuming tb2's electronics weren't damaged, but yeah, i'd be pretty shocked if ir didn't have hardened equipment. thanks!thunderbird 2, without a doubt. and i actually think the way the pods are being handled in this new series beats out the old series. making thunderbird 2 into a mobile fabrication lab is a really smart thing to do.

and definitely scott. i'm more of a second in command.ok, i figured it'd be scientific software. i had a meteorology lab that required linux for the software we were using (nmap2). that scene from pacific rim actually pissed me off enough to make me pause the movie, get up, and yell at a roommate about how idiotic it is.

in short: anything with an electrical circuit is vulnerable to an emp. the amount of electricity the emp puts through the circuit pathways is enough to literally burn them out. military hardware *should* be insulated from such problems, which is why i was so mad about gypsy danger and the other jaegers (also: nuclear doesn't mean analog, holy crap). 

that being said, i'm amazed that ir hardware isn't insulated against emp effect, but hey. i'm genuinely curious, which programs?ding ding ding. in the rare situation where you actually can't do something easily in one os that you can in a different one, most people don't get high and mighty about it.

fights only exist when the two oses do the same thing. the reality, though, is that that's the right answer.

windows, windows phone, osx, ios, linux/unix, android... you've got so many different choices for operating systems that can all do the same exact things that at the end of the day, the superiority argument boils down to "which os do i work best with?" it's the "one size fits all" people who apparently manage to be the loudest.

it's the exact same thing i tell incoming cs undergrads at my university: get whichever os you're most comfortable with, and put it on the most durable hardware you can find. at the end of the day, you're just going to secure shell into the department servers to write code anyway. so basically everybody. first lesson of any critical thinking course (should be):

just because you use critical thinking skills does not mean everyone else does. knowing how to overcome this issue is significantly more useful than simply knowing how to think critically. the developers *said that*.we don't know.no, i think virgil was right, it should be electromagnetic force. electromotive force is a measure for potential energy of electricity, while electromagnetic force focuses on the interactions between physically charged particles (positive ion meets negative ion).

whatever the luddites were using, it was analogous to an *e*lectro*m*agnetic *p*ulse (emp), so i think it should have been electromagnetic, not electromotive. wouldn't analog radio signals still be affected by electromagnetic disturbances?i think part of the problem is that these episodes aren't being aired in order of production. it's possible that earlier episodes flesh this out a bit more, we just haven't seen them yet. same link posted twice, there.

unless that was the joke, in which case i'm dumb. virgil's looks like it's a lot of tools, probably further fleshing out his role as the heavy lifting and demolitions guy. no, i don't think she was. the bms devs were very careful about making sure no additional dialogue was added.

...unless it's something where you have to keep interacting with him to get him to talk about her, in which case i think that may have been a rare encounter type of situation. 

merits further investigation. well it was being developed for the military, and the sneak suit had armor, so i find it hard to believe that such a mass-produced (within big mountain) piece of equipment wouldn't have been armored at that point.

plus, fallout technology is clunky (part of the charm). i'd expect to see mechanical joints and servos at the very least. i agree with /u/blamehoffman2501. aesthetically it fit, you're right, but the suits didn't make a damn lick of sense for combat equipment.

huge glass bubble, no body armor, no obvious external robotics to move the body, etc. 

plus it was a lazy recycle. probably my favorite, actually.if you get an f in a class, it cannot be used for credit, full stop. 

in regards to a d, i believe that depends on your specific department. sure. 

first thing to very clearly state is that ai is all about creating a program that is *rational*, or a program that takes every action available to it (this part is the important part) such that it maximizes positive results (some scoring function, like "make as much money as possible" or "win the game in as few moves as possible")

in short: ai is already pretty tricky to design when all of the boundaries and rules are known. an example of a well defined defined set of boundaries and rules is chess or tic-tac-toe. 

when your boundaries and rules are defined and constant (or at least predictable), it's possible to build a program that tries to maximize the value of its scoring function using some common algorithm (pathfinding algorithms like a*, un/directed graphs, decision trees, etc). 

but what gets sticky (and is the focus of some areas of ai research) is when we *don't* know all of the rules, or if the number of rules is so great that it becomes incredibly difficult to come up with some accompanying logic. 

that is why things like natural language processing is so hard. human language is chock full of rules, hidden meanings, double meanings, etc, and it's very difficult to really build a rule set for an entire language. 

we can *kind of* make some things work; for example, siri, google now, and cortana. these programs use a mixture of clever-yet-stupid algorithms (such as splitting sentences into single words and smashing that against a database), and heavily rely on prepared queries ("give me directions to x", "call y", "what is z", etc). 

same goes for "learning" programs (machine learning is what we really call it). the reality is that most machine learning algorithms are nothing more than best fit lines from your high school algebra classes, though they sometimes get more complex (say, a network of best fit lines, or clustering algorithms). 

typically, in machine learning, you take some sample set of data (for example, yelp data) and crunch the numbers to produce some model. then, you take that model and apply new data to it and see if the model is accurate enough to do something with it. 

the problem, though, is that sometimes your data doesn't "converge" and you're left with essentially meaningless rules. a great example is health-care data: it would be great if we could run all of the us' healthcare data through a machine learning algorithm and see if we could predict who would get cancer based on that model.

the reality, however, is that there is so much unrelated information being looked at that the model gets confused and never produces anything useful. this happens for a whole mess of reasons in statistics and linear algebra that i'm not super certain of, but it's a problem being studied by mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists. 

so, all of that together paints the picture that it's wickedly difficult to build an "intelligent" ai that can function in our world like you or i. and, like i said, it's not a matter of computational power. we simply lack the knowledge of how to build the right rules and logic for such an undertaking, to the point that it's impossible in the short term.

tl;dr: it's hard writing ai that works with known rules and small data sets. unknown numbers of rules and huge data sets really fuck us to the point of uselessness. was that equipment actually mobilized in baltimore?

i thought i'd have heard more screaming about it on reddit.what a weird way to measure self worth.officers understand why the services are different, and why each is needed to keep their men alive.yeah but dat tali tho.look, texas isn't mississippi or missouri. that counts for something.yes. deep down you just know it's true, and it's a fucking travesty.since i am wrapping up my cs degree with a concentration in machine intelligence (ai and machine learning):

i don't really have any thoughts on it. what real ai is and what the public thinks ai is are wildly different, so much so that their only similarity is the name.super liberal by 1930's standards?i just did, looks like i found a maus killer.

hmm. maybe my aim just sucked before. both him and dawkins are so far up their own assholes that i'm sometimes amazed they haven't looped out of the universe. "i don't know what i'm taking about, i admit as much, but i just want to feel relevant to this conversation."dawkins ain't much better.i've tried that with the su-155's he rounds, never gotten a kill.

that's on arcade, too.su-155 can't do it from the from, last i checked. how the heck can the kv-2 do it?kv-2 can't kill a maus from a side shot.it's wonderful science fiction.unless your soon-to-be fiance is a geologist or jeweler, get her an artificial stone like cubic zirconium, or a lab grown diamond. then the only pricey point is the metal.

or, do what i did, and do something so unusual that the stone is actually the [cheapest part](http://imgur.com/a/ralnl#0). &gt; /r/worldoftanks

well there's your problem.

/r/warthunder 4 lyfe.

edit: you guys aren't really that up to date on the war thunder / world of tanks/warplanes drama, huh?oh shit, suddenly i recognize this guy.
fuck i'm jealous of your flair. it's in the fucking name and everything.i don't know, that still doesn't jive with what the idea of g-men are. i don't think the g-man is after physical resources.no, it's pretty clear that the g-man is working for... *somebody*. who, we don't really know, but we know he's working for some third power. that makes no sense. it's the responsibility of the consumer to figure that out, not valve's. 

if the return policy is boosted to 5-7 days and people *still* lose their money, then they're just idiots. 8chan, the one stop shop for all of your well written, thoughtful news. knowing how to do math probably helps.re-read what i wrote.
i was being a tad hyperbolic, but i think you got what i was saying.

the bethesda thing, like you said, was them pretty much giving mod makers free reign over what they did. and, like you said, the community hated modders for wanting money. well i do give a fuck about modders, and i think this was the first time *anyone* actually tried to do something to pay them back.

was valve and bethesda going to make a buck? yeah, they were. but at least modders had a shot at making some money on their hard work. exactly. my read of the public's sentiment on this was that they hated the idea of *paying for mods entirely*. not the specific implementation. "how *dare* you think you could possibly ask us for money!"
i would. there are a large number of mods from kerbal space program that i would *gladly* pay for.i disagree, but i would absolutely be willing to say that it would require some serious modification.

but i didn't see anyone saying they would be open to paying for mods. and those are also valid criticisms, but that *wasn't what i saw the community talking about*. 

that's my whole point here: i saw *one* thing from the community, and that wasn't valid and *constructive* criticism. instead, i watched a community go absolutely apeshit, doing such a massive 180 on their opinion of valve that i don't believe for a *second* that anyone thought the idea had merit. 

and i believe that's a valid criticism, though i also believe that was bethesda's fault for not really communicating to valve that reality. 

but i do not believe for a second that that was why the community lost its shit. which is what's so fucking sickening. it wasn't valve *forcing every developer* to charge for mods. it was giving them the ability to do so, for the first time *ever*. 

like i said, this was the community at large giving a huge middle finger to the mod developer community saying "we refuse to pay you for your hard work and creativity. get back to making us free shit in your own time."i am 100% disgusted with the community on this. everyone immediately began screaming about how this was a blatant cash grab on the part of valve, and i don't think any more than maybe 15% of the community even stopped to consider that *maybe* this is something that could help mod developers.

**i saw nobody seriously talking about ways to improve this system, and everybody saying it was the worst thing ever done.**

i think valve was entitled to a cut of the profit. 25% might be too high, but i didn't see anyone really talking about lowering it; just people wanting 100% to go to the mod developer. i'd also agree that the minimum sale threshold was a bit silly, and at least i saw a *few* people commenting on it. 

i think the game developer was entitled to a cut of the profit. bethesda, in my own opinion, took *way* too much, but i absolutely believe they get a cut of the money for providing a basis for mod developers.

i think opening up the workshop to possible monetization was a *good* thing. it offered at least a pittance of the payback mod developers deserve for 25+ years of interesting content. 

opting for a donate button is, in my opinion, a way for the community to *feel* like they were supporting developers without actually supporting them. i would strongly argue that the majority of "donate button" advocates wouldn't donate in a million years, and the calls for such a system equate to nothing more than a "fuck you" from the public.

as someone who's dabbled in mod making in the past, this whole thing proves to me that gamers want nothing but free entertainment, developer be damned. i've never heard of more than a tiny handful of mods garnering enough public support that the creator actually makes any money.

tl;dr: i think the public fucking over reacted. that's how it *should* be, but this chucklefuck is trying to be all tacticool. based on the patch on his vest, i'm betting he's nothing more than an airsofter. i don't really know if i'd call this film retro-futuristic. it's got elements in it, believe me (just look at the taxi cab!), but this doesn't nail it for me. 

then again, this film is coming up on 20 years old... we've got, like, two good radio stations and about 300 evangelical christian stations after 6pm. 

it's hard to listen to. alt-103 beat the shit out of x-103.

but neither beat wfyi 90.1.everyone was predicting that this would be a titanfall knockoff, but this is very clearly looking like it heavily drew from the newer deus ex games. ok, but that didn't answer the question. all you said was "look, i can access these other boards!"

you cannot show whether or not the board owner decided to restrict that. and frankly, with the huge number of vitriolic and otherwise useless comments, i would restrict those boards too if i were the content creator. and can you prove that it was valve censoring a post and not a forum rule preventing non-purchasers from commenting on a mod?
so then this is a failure of *bethesda*, not *valve*. *bethesda* decided to enable monetization of mods; valve only built the tool into steam. and just imagine how much it costs to run steam. makes that 15% seem pretty reasonable.oh. bitchin.source? the sheridan didn't see service until the 60's, it doesn't fit the time frame of the game.love the city, hate this state. regardless of the outcry the rfra caused, i can't get past the fact that politicians who were for the bill in the first place got elected at all.the modder gets whatever the developer thinks is fair. in bethesda's case, it's 25% (they bethesda takes 60%, valve takes 15% across the board). 

and if a mod developer wants to charge for their mod, i think that's well within their fucking right, *especially* if the game developer oks it.

where do you people think team fortress and counter strike came from? if the developer enables charging, then the decision on whether or not an individual mod charges for money rests on the mod creator alone.hey! get those well reasoned thoughts out of here! we're trying to circlejerk, here!to be fair, i want to get the hell out of indy, but i'd still stay the fuck away from the valley (despite being cs). :*not denorex, but i do use t-sal, and it does help.

problem is, she's not joking about the 60-70% coverage of my *whole body*. eczema isn't really the same thing. plus, if that worked, i'd have heard about it by now (i've had the stuff for 8+ years). clobex (clobetasol) is something i use regularly, and it actually works pretty well.

but humira, enbrel, otezla, and stelara are all pretty damn pricey. d:yes, and also high-strength prescription stuff too. it helps, but dermas don't like using it for too long because of it's nature as a steroid. topical or something you eat?comes and goes. sort of depends on the humidity.i do do that! helps with the scalp, but not the rest of the body (she wasn't joking about the 60-70% coverage).

which reminds me, i need to by more t-sal. diet probably is a large factor for me. i don't eat *unhealthy* (i do eat a fair amount of veggies and fruit, especially considering i'm in college), but i could always be more healthy.actually yes, i have. they're not as helpful as i'd like though. expensive as hell, but i've looked into it.sup, fucker.hmmm.... she'd probably be down for that.expensive as dicks. been prescribed humira, enbrel, otezla, and stelara, and all are north of $2k per dose/refill. 

i'm starting a new job in the coming months, though, so i may check to see how my new insurance wants to play it. yeah, i have. i'm aware it can cause flare ups, but my particular flavor of psoriasis is vulgaris guttate, so it tends to be a pretty constant thing.

so far, stress seems to be the big fish in what causes the flare ups. but even when i'm relaxed, i'm looking at a 40% coverage. /u/arkookami's fiance, here.

yes, i have. i go somewhere between biannually and yearly. 

humira, though, is fucking expensive. i was prescribed it once, and it was looking at something like $2 grand a dose. i've been trying to get the discount card for it, but it's slow going. boy do i envy you. tried that. dermatologists sort of agree that it helps, but there isn't any agreement on whether or not it's worth the increased risk of skin cancer. hey. fuck you. god i wish. i spend too much time on reddit. 

(i'm /u/arkookami's fiance). it fits the story.hey, i liked it. but hopefully that answers your question. see for yourself:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_uhwl31vfyi grew up building polystyrene models of tanks and planes and stuff, so i kinda learned what kind of detail is possible at different scales. 

when you see things like nuts and bolts on models, you can sort of get a sense of the largest possible size of things. from what i understand:

rifled barrels reduce the number of types of shell you can put through them. for example, discarding sabot cannot be put through rifled barrels (i think). if this sub is to be believed:

the best ones were the ones that weren't the current page.

the worst one is the current page. yeah, that's what i meant. like i said, these are some *damn* big models. even without having the guy to scale it against, you can get a pretty good sense of the scale if you've ever done any hobby model building.

i honestly don't know how much they spend on the models, either. i can't wrap my head around it. for this resolution and size, these are *huge* models. we're talking 15+ feet in any direction.

heck, lady penelope's mansion is close to 10-12 feet by itself, based on the itv documentaries. i know, that's what i'm saying. i think that's why the firefly and the mole didn't both leave track prints. my parents haven't seen any of the new episodes (they watched the originals; same age as your dad), but i showed them the launching sequences of thunderbird 1 and 2, and they thought it was great.

i think the fact that so many original fans are actually finding this show a suitable successor to the 1960's show is pretty telling of how much the creators cared about this franchise. it was the same thing with the footprints in the mine: scott didn't leave any, but the girl did.

i think /u/godoflaziness is right; all of the vehicles are cgi, but i swear they're really making me think about it. &gt; i like a lot of the new things too, new gadgets, 

virgil and thunderbird 2 are just fantastic. not to give away any spoilers, but ep.04 crosscut shows off some pretty great improvements to thunderbird 2 and the equipment the pods carry.

i don't think this new series is better than the original series, but it's definitely an updated version suited well for this generation of children. it manages to more or less capture the atmosphere and theme of the show, and doesn't sacrifice anything the older fans came to love (except the marionettes). they lost for purely political reasons. in no way did the unsc manage to pull out the military victory, and had the politics taken another few weeks, humanity would have been glass.

we got our asses handed to us. not in game.the *chief* did, yes. not humanity as a whole.same goes for scott's footprints in the mine. he doesn't move any dust on the floor.very well. they killed more of us than we killed them.

we just lucked out politically.because bungie frankly didn't give a fuck about the expanded universe. 

take two guesses why destiny's story is lackluster.yes. i think the same thing was echoed in halo 3? i don't fully remember.

but yes, he was chosen because he was lucky. even when other spartans had obvious superiorities.about that, yeah. i think he was in his 40s during the events of halo 1-3?but even then, that's your mind putting value to what you're doing, not the game. that's applicable to so many other games that i wouldn't call it a selling point.i see where you're coming from, but i think that's a more apt explanation for how the media was handled in iraq compared to vietnam, not vietnam compared to wwii.

the job of the media and pr people in wwii was made a *hell* of a lot easier simply because most americans actually have ties to their european brethren. hell, most americans had family in europe at that time, so hitler steamrolling the french or bombing the english actually made some impact on the public's emotions.

same goes for the pacific campaign: quite simply, they punched first, and americans wanted blood. 

&gt; all of these anti-establishment elements combined with the more vivid and horrific images we were getting from vietnam. all of the sudden, war was not a righteous thing that every young man wanted to take part in, citizenship and duty were not as highly valued when it was clear that our involvement in vietnam was more political than anything else.

same thing happened between wwi and wwii, though. the [bonus army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bonus_army), for example, is a pretty great example of how americans weren't really that thrilled with the government, either. perhaps not to the degree that the vietnam era was, but i could argue that that was (again) due to the nature of wwi vs that of vietnam.

it was a *very* complicated era. i just don't think it was made easier by the fact that nobody fucking cared about vietnam, but everyone cared about england and france, and exacting revenge on the japanese.by that argument, *every* game is deep. 

"boy, i wonder how russian soldier #1251321's family will feel when they get the shredded remains of his body in a box?" while playing cod:mw3.

and that reinforces my point: your character in the stalker games is incredibly 2d because it's supposed to be a reflection of *you*. but the universe in the game itself doesn't care what you do, and you can't really make much of an impact on it other than siding with either duty or freedom. mostly, yes. grad students aren't supposed to have the time to give a shit about other schools. &gt; also, i bet locke has more advanced armor than john.

equipment is only part of the battle. i agree with /u/reclaimer879: the chief is simply the better soldier.raw and vivid is only part of it. 

the other part is a meaning to the conflict, something that the people at home actually care about. something, *anything*, to keep morale strong in the face of otherwise horrible casualties.

vietnam quite simply didn't have that. it was a war in a disgusting jungle against a foe we didn't understand who was fighting for control of a country nobody cared about. vietnam had no resources, no meaningful worth to the us and its people, and certainly wasn't worth choking to death on your own blood in a steamy mudhole. 

*that* was why america lost the vietnam conflict. nobody cared because there frankly wasn't any reason to care. we didn't want to fight, we didn't need to fight, and the vivid television only served to show the price of fighting for nothing. not the whole picture.

we had the same, if not more, coverage of the second world war than we did the vietnam war. while there were differences (less color tv, and tv in general), a lot more of it had to do with the fact that frankly nobody cared about *why* we were in vietnam.

*that* was what the vietnamese leveraged. they knew that the brutal and bloody fighting, when broadcast back in the us, would seriously make americans wonder what the fuck we were doing in a jungle in the ass-end of the world.

the fact of the matter is that to the average american citizen, we had *no reason* to be involved in vietnam at all, especially towards the end of the war.&gt; perhaps it's the nature of the mission people have issues with.

that's absolutely the reason. take a look at the war in iraq and afghanistan in 2003 and the same war in 2008, and you can see a night and day difference in how much the american public cares.this worked for me, thanks!basically. all i know about rh is that one of their students thinks that uranium is inherently explosive.oooh, that lone $500 graphics card is so much more accessible.no, both of my parents went to their respective schools for grad school. grad students have neither the time, money, or energy to pull that sort of shenanigans off. i think this is technically a cop-out answer, but only if we're talking about the original series where computers and ai were a still pretty foreign idea. 

in this new series, i could absolutely see this being the case. john's station up in thunderbird 5 feels more like an omnipotent eye in the sky, capable of guiding and instructing just about everything necessary to keep people safe.

i would be surprised if thunderbird 5's computers didn't already do this.so a sports rivalry, which is entirely different from an academic rivalry.so then what does? football?i've got a copy of a book called nightwork: a history of hacks and pranks at mit (pub. 2003) and there's an entire section on the mit/caltech rivalry and the various pranks.

also: both of my parents (dad is caltech alum, mom is mit) attested to the rivalry, and they graduated sometime in the 80s. you missed the pretty obvious sarcasm. spelling. 1) purdue.

2) yes. get on my level.

edit: also, much love to the people who think we're an ivy league or private school. you make us feel all warm and tingly inside. son of a caltech grad and an mit grad here:

that's just because there isn't any real way to act out the rivalry. yeah, every once in a while something happens like a canon getting stolen, but you don't have things like football games in which the rivalry is really obvious.

take, for example, my school: purdue. we've got a pretty good rivalry with iu bloomington because of sports; five or six times a year, both schools come together for football, basketball, etc. but academic rivals (say, rose-hulman) never get mentioned because there's never interactions between rh and purdue students.http://web.mit.edu/facts/tuition.htmli believe you're thinking of oil refineries, not chemical plants, but i'm not 100% sure. yes, that is the chernobyl #4 npp.yes, that is the chernobyl #4 npp.you must have had a crappy childhood. i'm sorry.i did, bit showing someone pictures of something doesn't explain anything. the mark of whether or not you understand something is how well you can explain, in your own words, how that thing works.maybe it's because war and peace isn't high school literature?...shocking nobody ever. 

also: heinlein's starship troopers is not a humorous comedy about fascist propaganda and long shower scenes. 

never were the message of a book and film so diametrically opposed.ayn rand was a bad author with even worse political views. she's basically the root cause of the american "fuck you, i got mine" mentality.take a wild guess at what computer science boils down to.fahrenheit 451 is even closer to reality.i don't know. it's good, yeah, but not as good as other classic dystopian literature. after reading zamyatin's *we*, 1984 almost feels like a blatant rip off.

but i *really* hate 1984 because it's easily the most misunderstood book in the public's arsenal. "dae big brother!?" and "internet slang is just oceania's newspeak!" are just so frequently jammed into political conversations that you'd swear it was the only book people read in high school.

there's just so many better dystopian stories out there. you didn't answer the question.possibly different vehicle chassis? we know at least one of the pods contains grapple equipment for lifting jobs (ep.02's grappling lines, for example). i'd also bet that another pod is a mobile laboratory (based on the original series).

other vehicle chassis include the thunderizer and laser tractors, and the lifting trucks. it appears that there are multiple "kits" in pod 2 that can be fitted to the common chassis. maybe it's just a way to be very flexible in equipment carried?the thunderbirds as a franchise was nuclear heavy as a whole. the forward in the international rescue owners manual even attributes much of the technology to the advancements of nuclear energy.why do you think heat shields are black?anyone else thinking of nathan fillion's character from the venture brothers?then he wouldn't be him.i'm finding myself constantly remembering that this is a cgi series. whenever they're interacting with the world (such as entering the mine in e04), you're just shocked to remember that *scott is 100% cgi!* the dirt and dust effects are so reminiscent of the original series that i could love this show even if it had the worst writing imaginable.

the machines are, as far as i know, all cgi, though honestly i wouldn't be surprised if weta had a few physical versions, too. the dozer sequence at the end of e04 made me seriously wonder if the vehicle wasn't a physical prop. 

i think the animations are making use of mocap, which really became cheaper in the past half-decade. what used to require an elaborate studio can now be done with a rather small budget. especially considering a lot of the modern fema has roots in the cold war civil defense, which is basically the grandpappy of the prepper movement. funnily enough, i know one of the cosplayers in this set.this is how i feel about gerry anderson's son when he complains about the new cgi thunderbirds series because they didn't use marionettes.

like, dude, shut up. anderson *hated* working with the marionettes and said so often. his longest running gripe about the franchise was that nobody would give him enough money for a live action series.actually a pretty good cracked article for once. 

though i'd also add that the occult just isn't as popular anymore to that list.this is so true. add to that the fact that at the end of the day your school is secondary to what you can do in an interview and it just ceases being important.yeah, hawkeye!pot.*sigh*.

i need to remember to not point out nuance on reddit. everyone just assumes i'm defending an argument.right, so i more generally refer to them as public servants.they are, but a part of a servant's pay is clothing, housing, and food. you're right, they do get paid. just not much, and they're still typically dependent on their employer for food/housing/clothing. so *thats* how they explain the obvious discrepancy between the number of possible names and obviously larger number of droids in their universe.whoa, hold up: i've got no beef with fire departments, same goes for emts. even if they were paid 6 figures, i'd have nothing but the utmost respect for them.

i'm just saying that the guy's point seemed to be focused more on the term *servant* than anything else.it's heart breaking to see /r/kerbalspaceprogram linked here.

that said, that's a stupid as fuck fight.i think he would agree, but his point is that they actually fulfill the spirit of being a public *servant*, rather than a public employee, which is pretty much what all paid firefighters and police officers are. 

so, what, every homicide in the us is the product of some immense conspiracy?drinking.because your sub is dedicated solely to insulting and hating an entire group of people for no reason beyond your own amusement. 

holy binary belief system, batman...so you hate for your own amusement, because you know you're not actually making a difference?... it's only april...looks more like a real piece of hardware than iran's drone and stealth fighter.&gt; i do not really care if a deluded fat fuck dies 

so then this has literally nothing to do with constructive criticism and is nothing but plain, good old fashioned, bigoted hatred. don't like hard games? you're gonna have a bad time.

edit: also no "good or bad" alignments. you're character is more 2d than an xy plane.well......been there, done that. did you know the soviets treated the polish like saints? 

my dead ancestors sure didn't! i'm not quite as bad, but i'm running a phenom ii 965, 8gb of ram, and crossfire'd hd 6870's running a single 1280x1024. 

reason: monitors cost money, and i've lived like that my whole life so i don't have any better comparison. it's not /r/fatpeoplecritical. think long and hard about the community before you go to defend it.bullshit. that is 100% not the reason why you or anyone else subscribe to /r/fph. 

no idiot genuinely believes that flat out insulting, harassing, and making fun of others is an effective way of addressing their underlying problems. then maybe /r/fatlogic is a better place for you.

or: just don't go to either. there's literally no reason to make fun of people or their beliefs outside of you being an asshole. 

edit: that's not to say /r/fatlogic is good. in fact, it's almost as bad as fph. but at least they pretend to hide behind the "i'm just criticizing for the hamplanet's benefit!" like /u/poeticcorpse is doing. source?it's just one of those things where it's nice to have the choice.i'm cs (basically applied mathematics), and that's easily the best thing i've read all month.god fucking damn, how long has the onion has time travel technology??what's your basis for this? we can barely predict tomorrow's weather, how the hell can you predict something that's going to happen a whole au away on a body significantly more volatile than the earth?i'm going to keep it simple because, quite frankly, i'm not a nuclear engineer (my grandfather was, i'm just here).

quite simply: the process of splitting atoms (fission) is what we use to generate heat in power plants and the explosive force in bombs. what is actually going on at the atomic level is the same, but the main difference is the rate at which the atoms split.

in a bomb, the atoms are split as fast as possible to generate as much energy as possible (so that it's explode-y). additionally, we're aiming for as destructive a bomb possible, so we ideally split almost all of the atoms. 

so, when bomb explodes, almost all of the uranium is consumed in that brief instance, released as the explosive force we've come to know and love. hiroshima and nagasaki are safe today because of this (and the large amounts of work put into rebuilding and cleaning those two cities by the us). only a very minuscule part of the fallout from nuclear weapons are actually the nuclear fuel. 

reactors, on the other hand, do not try to split as many atoms as possible. this is largely because we can't control that, and also because we can't capture that energy that rapidly. therefore, reactors burn their atoms slowly, over the course of many months or years to get as much energy out as possible with as little losses as we can.

when chernobyl exploded, large chunks of un-fissioned uranium and plutonium were exposed and ejected from the core. unlike the fallout from bombs, very large amounts of the fallout from an accident like chernobyl are comprised of the nuclear fuel.
pfffffftthahahahahahahahahano, that was just a really stupid thing to say.what the hell? seriously, all i have is the tb5 morse code screen and email signup. seattle the city is nothing like seattle the subreddit. that goes for every local sub.we just want people to stop vandalizing our buses.yeah, though i honestly do a lot of my work from home. i've never really had an problems with pal3.0 (our campus-wide network) while i've used it.

resnet, the dormitory network, is even more reliable though.
what?survives, sure. have the comfort of knowing that the safety of themselves and their families is in their own hands and not in the police? no.

also: in the us, police response time is measured in minutes, largely because of how damn big our country is. or ssh/putty.**the os you feel most comfortable using.** you will write very little code directly on the machine, instead working heavily on the cs department's servers via ssh. windows, mac, linux, it doesn't matter, almost everything will be done with that ssh connection.

**the computer needs to be durable first, powerful last**. like i said, everything you do will be remote. compilation time is good largely because it's being done on a server and not your pc. for the odd class like cs180 where you do things directly on your computer, you won't be doing anything so computationally draining that you need a beefy machine.

*what i use:*

my current laptop is an aging toshiba satellite with a 24gb ssd running xubuntu, and it does everything you'll ever need for cs work at purdue.

for gaming, i have a windows 8.1 (soon to be windows 10) desktop that i built over the years. on the odd times i do things that require serious number crunching (statistics courses), i do my work from there.you're missing the entire point of steamos: it's not meant for gaming in general, it's meant for gaming on a single big screen from a couch with as few things keeping you from your stream library as possible.or balancing their jobs with their hobby.gimme some names.if it did, we'd see more games built in unreal with environments on the scale of what we see from gamebryo (ignoring the graphically light borderlands).more issues, sure. but they're not funded by a multi billion dollar company, either.not saying there is. but i still contend that unreal is still less suited to it.could be when the vault was ordered, too.probably just pertains to the order the vaults were built in.borderlands maps aren't that big, and certainly don't need the same resources as other more photo realistic games.this is why i would never vote for a scientist or an engineer. curve balls!

1) michael abrash or john carmack

2) grace hopperthe game hasn't come out yet. nobody knows. &gt; anyone could do if they had a 3d printer already

yeah, i'm going to stop you right there. color sandstone printing machines are stupidly expensive and still *well* beyond consumer available. everyone else has already mostly nailed it, but the shortest possible answer is that our universe focused on computers, the fallout universe focused on nuclear energy.

nuclear batteries, nuclear cars, nuclear infused soda, nuclear rockets and planes, nuclear vaccum cleaners, nuclear powered weapons and armor, etc etc etc. that's like saying we sold them all the parts of a glock but claiming we didn't actually sell them a gun. the us knew exactly what they were doing.no, iraq had chemical weapons. we sold them to them, and we knew they were there going in.platinum does the same.a few major things:

1) the first thunderbirds are go rescues shown aren't ir's first rescues, unlike "terror in the sky" from the original franchise. if it were a reboot, they would have started with their first rescue.

2) in the first few minutes, scott is talking about how they're retrofitting thunderbird 1. "retrofitting" is a pretty perfect way to explain why the vehicles look different compared to the original series.

3) the tracy brothers are all well aware of the hood, and all suspect him in jeff's disappearance. to my knowledge, ir was completely unaware of the hood during the original series, and only dealt with him indirectly. it makes sense to use the hood to explain jeff's absence, and ir's awareness of the hood in the new series sort of adds to my theory.it's a kids show that has had a lot of very well executed nods to the original series. 

the 2004 film was "just a kids" film. right, so in the scene, he says something like "do the tracy's know that the demise of their father was the work of your (kayo's) uncle (the hood)?"

and in the original series, the hood can control kyrano from afar using... honestly don't know what. so my inclination is that the hood used kyrano to kill/disappear jeff.

&gt; it's not. they've said that quite a bit in interviews. it's a spiritual sequel, but it's not a continuation.

that doesn't really refute my belief. just queued the scene up. your right, he said "uncle".

then again, if this series is a continuation (like i suspect), it probably *was* kyrano who was responsible for jeff's demise, acting on behalf of the hood. yeah it wasn't great.i like this one the most. the difference between, say, /r/artisanvideos and /r/diy should be that /r/artisanvideos showcases people who've refined their skill with a *lot* of practice, while /r/diy is people just showcasing their (mostly) amateur work.

both have their merits! frankly, /r/diy has a much broader spectrum of products made, but /r/artisanvideos has some absolutely elegant craftsmanship.

as were the other "ending" episodes. nope, 100% serious. my aunt (nz born) who lives in wellington actually says wee-ta, though it's still somewhat close to weh-ta (if you can sorta fudge the two together). 

i used to want to work for weta (still do, but my life went a different direction), so it came up in conversation a lot. that's how it's pronounced in the nz.

source: have family who live in wellington. i would argue that they felt real to you *because* you were a kid. i'm with you; i grew up with the series in the early 00's and believed them to be realistic, despite having better examples of realism to compare the series to.

the reason why you see the puppet version as realistic is because it doesn't require as much to fool a child's mind than it takes to fool an adults. a child's imagination is much more active and available to fill in the gaps, lending to a much more comprehensively painted picture than what an adult will see.

this also imprints on your memory, and is the fundamental reason as to why you *still* see the thunderbirds so fondly. you remember how realistic the show felt to a younger you, and that sticks in your mind even when the show isn't fooling your adult sensibilities. 

simply put, the reason why you don't see this new series as realistic is because you've lost this imaginative ability. your mind isn't as readily filling in the gaps, not because the show is different, but because you're older and this show is something you haven't seen before.

i would put substantial money on this belief, too. if you were to take kids who grow up watching thunderbirds are go, and then talk to them in 15 years, i would suspect that they would have found this series as realistic as you found the original.

significantly important edit:

*remember!* the thunderbirds as a series has always meant to be geared towards *children*, not adults. what clicks for kids doesn't always click for adults. i'm with you. the puppets felt like a product of necessity of the times; it was the most cost effective way to pull off that caliber of visual performance in the 60's. 

think of it like star trek; the sets and vehicles used in the thunderbirds are more detailed than the sets of star trek despite having comparable budgets and support largely because anderson chose doing everything to scale. 

doing it in scale lets you get more detailed for similar costs to full scale productions. rather than spending a ton of money ensuring your set is big enough for your characters to move around, you can do it to scale and squeeze out more detail with puppets. 

seriously, compare any star trek: tos set to that of the thunderbirds, and it's a laughable comparison. thunderbirds almost universally had better sets and vehicles at a cost of human actors, and i think that was simply a choice of anderson's regarding his values.

space: 1999 and ufo are also perfect antithesis to the idea that anderson was all about the puppets.wow. remaking the rescue from trapped in the sky?

i honestly can't tell if this series is supposed to be a continuation from the original series, or if it's supposed to be an entire reboot. they've actually hedged the story somewhere between the two such that i can't get a good read on which one it is. well then i wouldn't pretend to know the ideal course choice, then. 

all i got is my experience with vitek. yeah. $30 roundtrip to indianapolis friday night / monday morning, which is more or less comparable to gas prices a year ago. &gt; from the courses offered for the great issue requirement, which one would you say is the easiest/most interesting?

none of them, they're all horrible. seriously, i hope you like talking about everything fossil fuels, because the selection is super shitty. you'll look at the list and be like "oh! special nuclear materials! that sounds cool!" and then you find out the class was offered only once in like 2011 and you can't take it anymore.

&gt; my adviser told me it would be a bad idea to take cs 251 along with the courses above. 

cs 240 by itself *used* to basically be a meat grinder, but i don't know what it's like now. i've heard it's been made easier, but i can't confirm it.

cs 250 and cs 251 are normally taken side-by-side, so the issue really isn't 251 so much as it is 240. and even if they didn't fabricate it, it would be suppose easy to claim that they did.my grandparents actually live in the tacoma area, and i had to make the drive from puyallup to seatac on a thursday evening. i figured i'd be going the opposite direction of traffic, thinking people would be leaving seattle for surrounding areas, and it wouldn't take me more than an hour tops.

fuckin' three hour drive, holy christ. also, for a city that lives in pretty regular rain, you guys can't drive in the rain for shit. well, the hood thinks he's dead.when isn't your traffic a nightmare?well, the hood said her father was responsible for jeff's death, didn't he? or did i mishear what he said?gotta lead with the hook!

but i do see where you're coming from. if we revisited this discussion at the conclusion of season 1, we may have different opinions. &gt; what i meant was in the satellite scene when he is pulling cables out there is no real tension there, were as if it had been slowed down a little and had shown his hands moving across the cables and wires it could have created that tension.

fair enough. that tonal issue may get fixed going forward. it is the first episode after all, and i expect they'll fix it up as we go forward.

&gt; in the originals they may have been heroes but they were still human however in this episode at least they were just heroes there was very little humanity there.

i don't know. see, my original view of the series from the 60's was that it had a very "mission impossible" feeling, where everything more or less worked out and the characters remained relatively cool. 

especially the first episode of the original series; fireflash is coming down and honestly everyone was pretty chill. maybe that's just because i've watched the episode recently as an adult, but their expressions were for the most part pretty blank. yes. why we all hate this stupid mod. both of those feel more like limitations of the medium from the 60's more than anything.

the hands were real from the original series largely because you can't actually actuate those fingers in a meaningful or realistic way. 

the sweat is, i believe, so pronounced in the originals because doing anything with water on a scale model looks weird. it also didn't help that the original series sweat looked like water on plastic.i've never been able to get around the weird arguments people use to defend him.

&gt; "oh, he was just fighting for germany because he cared about his country!"

so he was a patriot? i thought reddit *hated* patriotism?

&gt; "he wasn't a willing member in the ss!"

so that somehow absolves him of still fighting for the nazi party, even without vocally supporting it? if he hadn't fought for the nazis, it's possible the war would have ended sooner!

there was next to nothing stopping such a capable leader from leaving germany. fucking hundreds of thousands of other people did it, and it's not like he had ample opportunity while serving thousands of miles away in fucking north africa!rommel was a solid commanding officer through and through.

still fought for the nazis.

i really love the people who praise rommel and then in the same breath scream about how operation paperclip is literally the most evil thing ever. oh my god i almost died laughing at that.

i love the idea of the tracy's having to go out and grab their chairs after every tb1 launch. this new version will *never* be what the original was, but honestly i think that's for the best. it's impossible to make lightning strike twice in the same place, and i think the creators know that.

this new series feels like it's doing its best to be faithful to the details of the original series, but with enough plot rewriting to feel like it's a natural progression. 

and while i was originally skeptical of thunderbird s (which should've been called something like thunderbird 0 to play off its stealth role), the concept is growing on me. 

the thunderbirds as a series has always existed in what we saw the future to be, and in the 60's, nobody predicted cameras and social media to be so ubiquitous. the entire idea of "operation coverup" is essentially impossible in the 10's view of the future, so the writers need to come up with a new solution.

and that's why i think thunderbird s is actually a smart move. tracy island needs substantial security now that they're basically a household name. i'll be interested to see how they play with it. what they're doing with john is great.

the amount of actual intel that he's dealing with now makes way more sense than what happened in the original series. he's the omnipotent eye-in-the-sky, and i strongly suspect he's the reason why certain thunderbirds equipment operates autonomously. &gt;  is it supposed to be as long content wise as new order was?

no.

&gt; does anyone know?

no.

&gt;  or is it more like dlc?

yes.the level of care that was put into retaining the accuracy of the launch sequences is nothing short of astounding. 

sorta building off what i said earlier, the attention to details and keeping things authentic is enough to keep me in love with this show even through the silliest details.his desk in general was just well done, especially in the context of their new lounge in general. *one of*.

it's also easier in undergrad because the curriculum is laid out for you and the time is already set aside.

but i'm not saying you can't learn a ton on your own at home.minor in what you want, not what is good for job prospects. undergrad college is one of the last times you'll ever have to study something for fun, so take advantage of it.

personally, i'm majoring in cs it a concentration in ai and minoring in theatrical design.well...

it won't actually do anything for your resume, that's for sure. 

also, i thought the university was phasing out ols because it was widely considered a joke degree designed for athletes? or was that just a rumor?just repeal the goddamn bill. what /u/kenbr7613 said: if this is for your actual lab science requirement, you need to take two science courses in sequence.not very long, actually. maybe two minutes per site. thunderbird 2 looks like it took some serious design cues from contemporary heavily lift helicopters and vtol aircraft, which i think is fantastic. 

my long time thought regarding an update to the designs has always been to make them look just a bit more realistic, but still maintaining their original profiles and detail. 

honestly, though, i think tb4 from the 2004 film was actually a pretty well thought out design, but i'm glad to see that these new designs are so closely mirroring the originals. their source web pages?not my point. 

in news subs, the articles that get posted in the first place are the ones that subscribe to the given subreddit's tendencies. you're seeing a limited selection of articles to begin with.

i want to see *all* of the articles, not just the ones cherry picked by reddit. right, but even then your filtering your news through individuals with certain political bents.

i only feel comfortable reading from the sources directly, because even news sources miss things. i'd rather keep the number of filters as low as possible. right, which brings us full circle to my original question:

"what idiot uses reddit for news?"i'm only responding to your last point (first point won't end well for anyone):

that's exactly why i don't like using reddit for news; the articles that get posted are relevant to the reddit collective, which leaves behind hundreds of articles that would just be ignored. you mean the "wave of feminists" that represent a miniscule minority of feminists as a whole and tends to be most vocal on tumblr?

because that's a perfect example of why reddit's user base is so scattered in beliefs; echo chambers influencing echo chambers.i disagree. their opinions are incohesive and disjointed to a level of absurdity.

"we're all for women's rights, but say feminism and you're an sjw." is probably the most obvious example.&gt; reddit just happens to have some good news from the middle ground most of the time.

i really hope you've actually just been here for 7 days, and not just using a new account, because that's the only way i can see you believing that.

reddit swings "brogressive", which is in the middle of the road by virtue of being all over it. is it not possible for those two objectives to be one and the same?

misspelled sergeant on the form. two: npr and bbc.wooooo!what fucking idiot relies on reddit for news?sub moderator, here:

i do with my sub what ever i want, and if you don't like it, eat a dick.

that's how reddit sub moderating works.odessa cubbage confirmed for hl3. people are only talking about john's role as the sniper, but it is worth pointing out that he voiced griggs and various citizens in half-life 2.you're a very trusting person.
exactly. the amazing thing about sb101 is that our government did such a good job building what is in essence a discrimination bill, that they totally missed the fact that it can be used to discriminate against anyone for any reason.

hell, if i believe middle class white men are the devil, i can deny them service. you can be damn sure that the indiana republicans didn't even realize that this opens even them up to discrimination.i'd think i'd have heard about the closure of the only apple store in my area. purdue didn't get a letter condemning sb101, but instead a very clearly worded reaffirmation of purdue's non-discrimination policies.

boy, can you say "brain drain"?in short, the enclave is the illuminati, just us-only. vault-tec was essentially a puppet organization. it's heavily implied that china threw the first punch, but it's still unclear (and hopefully remains that way). 

either way, the enclave *knew* it was coming, and ensured that it did. that doesn't answer the actual question, just the process the enclave took. 

the *actual* answer is that the enclave knew the earth was doomed, and were ultimately planning to leave the earth. however, they needed information on what kind of society and resources would be needed, and didn't have the ability to figure that out.

thus, the vaults were born. each was designed, like you said, to sustain different colonies of humans and observe the results. from there, the vaults that survived the best would be used as examples for the enclave's future colony. "is this an anti-gay law"

"no"

pretty fucking simple.nobody here knows what the hell they're talking about.

sb101 dictates that the government cannot impede an individual or business' right to practice their religion. basically, your right to practice your religion supersedes laws that may restrict your ability to practice your beliefs.

typically, the laws that presently exist regarding the freedom to practice your religion pertain *only* to you as an individual. your freedom to practice your beliefs exists only for yourself, but you cannot use those beliefs to influence the lives of others in commercial affairs.

what sb101 is doing is reducing the number of restrictions you have on your ability to practice your own religion, *including* any that exist if you are a business owner. the idea is that the right to practice your own belief supersedes the right of others to not be discriminated against.

for example, if you believe that being gay is a sin, you don't have to serve gay people as per your belief. if you believe that women shouldn't be allowed to handle money, you can refuse them service based on your belief. if you are a proponent of a warped view of sharia law, and believe that all non-believers are filthy, you're allowed to deny them service.

source: hoosier.mike pence was asked *12 times* to clarify whether or not it was specifically an anti-gay law, and managed to avoid answering the binary question 12 times. hoosier here:

good. put the pressure on.i can confirm experiencing a decline in the "i'm showing off i'm smart" people, too.

they tend to bail out of the cs program when their egos get shit on by the realities of the field. hey, we're just really busy.til, thanks!are we certain it's not c#? it's a microsoft product, after all, and both translate the same to machine code more or less. yes, it was 100% bullshit designed to scare people.wouldn't that just be confirmation bias, though? you don't see the threads that push the buttons because they get downvoted and buried.ah. i read it that you preferred having multiple cheaper platforms.mid and upper level cs relies on linear algebra, calculus, statistics, probability, and discrete mathematics pretty heavily. 

ap cs is *not* representative of cs as a field. coming from someone who took ap cs and graduates with my bachelors in cs in about a month, the two are so unrelated it's actually pretty funny.the multi-role requirement for the f-35 came from congress and the other contributing members, not from the developer.yes, but that isn't the fault of the developer. that's a congress problem.no 1984?

it's reddit's favorite (read: only) dystopian literature book.exactly. and, like you said, a fifth-generation fighter jet is way more complicated than anyone is really aware of. 

the fact that equipment that complex is able to mostly work *in the first place* is marvel of modern engineering. $50 says the projection was run by opponents of the project, knowing full well that people wouldn't be able to make the distinction. yeah. like /u/dragon029 said, the cost is the projected cost from 1996 to 2065, and that includes the amount of money actually spent on each unit including maintenance and other costs, not just r&amp;d.

the cost argument is just total bullshit. especially considering congress keeps buying m1 abrams tanks, even when the army asked them not to. clearly money isn't the concern. you realize that:

a) native americans are allowed to own any property in the us they wish, just like any other person.

b) argentina is the product of the exact same colonization the us/canada are.do you think she got death threats from women regarding this?i did and i don't agree with your read of what she said.

frankly, if i made a joke and got death threats, i'd write about it, too. people are always like "oh god, the f-35 has had so many problems, we should just cancel the program! stick with the old f-16s and -15s!"

always makes me wonder if they know just how many problems all weapons programs encounter in the development phase. i know of exactly *one* weapon system that was built and worked better than expected (su-152). 

i also think it's funny that they always balk at the price tag. newsflash: committing to purchasing one number of units, then going back on that number and lowering it tends to raise the price-per-unit.  cost of r&amp;d is built into the ppu, and the more you buy the cheaper each is.

not to mention the total program cost is the projected lifetime cost, and not the cost to date, and that the program is being funded by more than just the us seems to be oddly absent from the discussion.it is! the russians knew how to build cheap but very reliable shit.you made an unsubstantiated claim. that's why you're being downvoted.that's pretty much the primary reason why it's so heavily utilized. it's also pretty remarkable that the rocket used to carry the soyuz spacecraft is the r-7 (aka the world's *first* icbm), which was first built in *1957*. 

the r-7 carried sputnik, vostok, voskhod, soyuz, and progress. it'd be like the us using the redstone to carry all of our equipment into space.they are, and while it is wasteful, they're far more reliable than reusable equipment. 
soyuz has more launches than any other spacecraft in history, and only three fatalities. 

compare that to the reusable sts and its 14 casualties, and you sort of prefer expendable.that doesn't jive with the actual years, though. two things:

1) i believe some of the most severe estimates for number of nuclear strikes were in the thousands, and that's at the height of *our* cold war. imagine the number of bombs dropped on the us in the fallout-verse. i think you could reasonably expect most regions to be hit, though maybe not evenly.

2) fallout was well documented to travel tens to hundreds of miles downwind from ground zero, and that's just what we know from single detonations. it would be very easy to see the fallout spreading virtually every where in the northern hemisphere, even in rain-light regions like the mojave.

nuclear explosions also suck debris into the air, so for a few weeks after the war you could probably expect more than normal cloud coverage world over, which could take years to stabilize. this is the principal cause of what's known as a nuclear winter.that's vaguely sociopathic.

"i play violent games for fun, i don't want to feel bad about the violence."

on some level, you *should* feel some emotions about the content.not that i know of. i'm just thinking of futuramavelour? not much unless you intentionally inhale the dirt and dust debris.i don't want to say that i'm a wizard with ai, but i do believe i "get" it like you do.

i feel the exact same way. i strongly suspect that a large part of the problem has to do with humans being intelligent, and therefore subconsciously skipping steps in describing the process.x-ray and vav is an inside joke within itself.

i think that's why it was so damn funny. depends pretty heavily on the field. because gabe doesn't want to say something and then have to go back on it. 
hasn't been my experience. if someone gets a job through a friend, but isn't at all competent, they don't hold that job for very long. 

it's *very* hard to fake knowing how to write web servers or operating systems or machine learning algorithms. and ultimately, *that* is what employers are looking for.valve has echoed that sentiment time and again. though they also say that they're their own greatest critics, and haven't been able to satisfy their own demands, much less the public's.every month? i don't remember ever seeing it. it's optional, but i believe it's an opt-out thing, not an opt-in.

i bet you $50 that the majority of people who's jimmies are rustled are still opted into the steam survey. i don't need to make any, i've yet to see a single explanation as to why hardware hash collection is at all harmful. 

origin has your ip address, credit card number, email address, and your name. but you're drawing the line at a hardware hash that doesn't even tell ea what parts you're using?

*that's* where you draw the line?prevents hacking. instead of banning accounts, ban hardware hashes. that nukes the people who have multiple origin accounts just for hacking.

it's actually an elegant solution to the problem.not that i know of. though i wish the computer's hardware hash was associated with accounts. it'd help solve the hacking problem altogether.if csgo did this, it'd solve the hacking problems.steam does the same thing origin does.if i have five hardware swaps in a day, i'm not going to play games until i fully diagnose the problem.

that's a time measured in *days*, not hours. this restriction seems totally reasonable to me.achievement hunter joke. gavin free misspelled "mold" as "mould".not true in the tech industry. we're wising up to the "it's who you know" mentality because we keep getting idiots.

to a point, having connections is important, but if you aren't competent, you won't last long. mold is the word you're looking for, there, gavin.exactly. just like borderlands online.left libertarian is communism?

i'm genuinely confused; how'd you make that fit?i like what /u/kphth said, but i think there's another major concern:

there just isn't as much academic source material for arm as there is for mips. if you want to teach a course with mips, you've got something like 20 years of material created expressly for teaching students. arm doesn't have that wealth of material, so any course teaching it basically gets to start from scratch.

that isn't to say that there aren't arm courses out there. some of my school's "topics in" classes have covered arm in the past, but the structure of those classes is a lot more, uh, "seat of the pants" learning than a more traditional classroom setting.

in short, the professor needs to write the arm curriculum from scratch, whereas the structure and material for mips courses is already pretty much established.i got the exact opposite impression. based on what he said, it's been an ongoing project for quite a while, but they have no definitive release schedule because they believe it would hamper their work.

valve has always employed the "when it's done" mentality, and because of the extreme expectations, "done" is a long, *long* way off. fakefactory added a bedroom (presumably belonging to alyx) to black mesa east. one of the features of said bedroom is a dildo.

i'm not terribly excited by the sexualization of a character that doesn't need it. any mod that doesn't add dildo's for alyx is a vast improvement over fakefactory. oh i think it'd be pretty damn easy to convince another city to pay the cancellation penalty. 

after all, that penalty pales in comparison to the $50 million the convention brings to indianapolis each year. get a 5 year contract with gencon, and you're looking at roughly a quarter of a billion dollars in revenue. a lot of butthurt people in that sub. sure. and the people you sue can countersue for damages/cost incurred. you can sue, but you won't necessarily win. pc is dominate almost everywhere in the world except for the us and japan. russia in particular is a *huge* country for pc gaming (you'll hear a lot of jokes in pc communities about getting stuck with nothing but russian speakers in a chat). additionally, f2p games are incredibly popular in russia, more so than most other places. 

it actually makes a ton of sense to drop a pc-exclusive f2p game in russia. thank christ, now my low-power guns can actually do something to kv-2s.

and seeing as this was originally about poland, and i have a significant polish heritage, you'll forgive me for caring about a country that a large chunk of my family calls home, as well as the immediate geopolitical surroundings.so then how the hell is iraq at all relevant to a conversation about russia and ukraine?

or are you intentionally trying to derail a conversation for no other reason than to paint the us as a bogeyman?not unless i read up on it.you realize that the precedent was set a *long* time ago, right? like, before the us was even formed?and that's 100% irrelevant, just like every other military action from over five years ago. bringing up "whataboutisms" is probably the most intellectually dishonest thing you can possibly do when talking about politics, because it ignores the actual present problems for no other reason than forwarding a political agenda. protect the base, sure.

annex 1/5 of a foreign country, no, absolutely not.pointing out a fallacy as a means to ignore another persons argument, that's a fallacy fallacy.cheap cost of living.

that's about all i can think of. i disagree. pence and the indiana government are giving the finger to native hoosiers, not gencon. &gt; i guess you missed maiden and the violent destabilization of ukraine that led to the democratically elected president being ousted.

you mean the violent uprising caused by the government ignoring the majority of ukrainian civilians who desired closer ties with the eu solely because russia told yanukovych not to pursue such relations?

edit: you know what, fuck that, too. ukraine's riots are *not* an invitation for russia to forcibly annex crimea. even if the riots were unjustified, *which they fucking weren't*, that doesn't give russia free reign to come in and fuck with ukrainian territory that *isn't theirs*. reactionary to....

what, exactly? i don't recall the us doing anything to cause the russians to, uh, "liberate" crimea. just check out his profile. /r/conspiracy subscriber, so probably doesn't have the strongest grip of history and sociology.&gt; do you think those people died for any reason other than greed, ignorance, and the high lords playing their game of thrones?

i *know* the soviet government decided to kill 22,000 polish men for the sole purpose of making poland weaker and easier to subjugate. hitler handed poland to the ussr on a silver platter, and the soviets would decimate the polish lands for no other reason than to feed their own people at the expense of the poles.

&gt; do you believe that russians are inherently evil

i know that the order to kill those 22,000 men came from the heads of the nkvd and josef stalin himself, men who were in power thanks to a *popular revolution* 30 years previously.

i don't see russians as inherently evil; i don't see anyone as inherently evil. but from the perspective of poland, the soviet government was built with massive public support in russia, and to some degree feel that those people are indirectly responsible for the deaths of so many and the forcible deportation and repatriation of thousands more.

&gt; if anything, you should take a look at yourself and then ask if you are being roped again into blind hate by a lying media, a media led by corrupt governments, governments comprised of rich old fucks who will never be in harms ways but will gladly sacrifice the commoners to make a dollar.

only fools believe the world marches to the tune of something as simple as money. 

my distrust towards russian aggression stems *solely* from my own family history; the deaths of countless men in my maternal lineage including my great grandfather and large numbers of his brothers and sons, the deportation, imprisonment, and mistreatment of my grandmother and the ragged remains of my family, and the 60 year exile of my grandparents and own mother.

at no point has the media actually factored into my consideration, and i pretty strongly believe that the same can be said about many in poland. the reality is that there is a *long* history of blood between the russian and polish people, and the aggressive actions of putin aren't making it easier to forget the past. &gt; the british and french get that awesome national healthcare, why the hell don't we?

[because despite spending over one and a half times (as a percent of gdp) what both france and england spend on their healthcare](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.xpd.totl.zs?order=wbapi_data_value_2012+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=desc), our health system is significantly less efficient. it has nothing to do with dollars spent and everything to do with underlying politics. 

theoretically, we should be able to *cut* our healthcare spending by a third and still have enough for a european style system. the reason we don't, and the reason why that won't happen, is because the us public is so against socialized anything that we end up filtering all of that money through private insurers, who have no motivation to ensure the system is efficient and cost effective. 

optimistically, a *third* of our health care spending is getting eaten up in administrative and bureaucratic overheads. realistically, with the number of people without health care at all, i'd wager that nearly a half of our total spending doesn't even go into the health system at all. &gt; have we learned nothing as a species?

based on your juvenile understanding of history, probably not.

you may want to read up on the second world war and the cold war. to say that russia routinely fucked poland would be an understatement and a half. 

hell, the katyn massacre [(the execution of 22,000 polish men at the hands of the soviets)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katyn_massacre) alone is probably enough to ensure that the poles will be extra cautious when it comes to russian aggression for quite a while still. not according to my polish family it's not. you should probably do that, too.

the muzzle looks fine to me. it appears to be pointed roughly at the light source, so the shadow typically seen in tubes is almost entirely hidden. played it back in '98. i don't recall it being any harder than other similar games of the period (namely quake 1 and 2). depends largely on what you find harder.

personally, i loved operating systems. the textbook is hands down one of the best i've ever read, and you can really "wow" people in interviews with your experience.not a telltale game, but i'd love to see a mass effect style rpg following the insurgency. halo from a game-only standpoint is *incredibly* shallow. it's the epitome of the "space marine" genre. 

it's not until you really start digging into the expanded universe material (books, comics, film, etc) that things get complex. not that i don't think halo has some amazingly rich backstory, but...

&gt; you wont find another game with such in depth lore and history

the elder scrolls, fallout, portal &amp; half-life, mass effect (like you mentioned), dragon age, resident evil, deus ex, and stalker all come to mind. yeah, maybe not all of them have books like halo, but most of what i listed above have just as much (if not more) story built around them.

plus, you've got franchises that extend beyond just games, too, like batman, star wars, the walking dead, the wolf among us, the lord of the rings, etc. 

heck, i'd even contend that compared to the titles i've listed, halo is a mediocre story from a *purely game perspective*. include books, sure, it compares quite favorably. but the games themselves are essentially story-light compared to some of those heavy hitters.

like i said, halo has a phenomenal expanded universe. i just wish that the games would follow it. yup.

don't get me wrong, i really do love the atmosphere downtown. 

but fuck if the state isn't trying its fucking hardest to make it hard to live here.exactly.i wouldn't consider slotin to not be a sharp fellow. stupid decisions aren't reserved for stupid people.yes.progressive folk are leaving, not coming. 
i can never not watch this .gif.possibly.

other possibilities: 

* "i downloaded a porn game" meaning additional software may have been installed.
* "i got a virus right around the time this happened" meaning additional software may have been installed.
* "i downloaded steam from downloads.com" meaning you probably got an illegitimate version of steam that won't run properly and is scalping your info. til about sayer's law. that's a good one.not to bring srdd into the mix, but i agree. the smart pistol's acquisition and kill time, even amped, are more or less comparable to any other weapon in game when you don't see the player coming, and significantly longer when you do.

basically.absolutely love this series, though i do agree with the recent criticisms that it's just recycling the same plot over and over again. not necessarily a conspiracy. but software doesn't just fail; something happened even if you don't immediately recall it.delete the file.

i strongly suspect there's something you're not telling us, too. i don't know, michael abrash has been making some waves in the vr field too.yes to the pretentious thing. carmel is the rich part of the city, and act like it, too.

source: hoosier born and bred, and a boilermaker to boot.i'm not a city sim vet, but i do notice that the game is missing natural disasters, something i believe was part of the simcity franchise.

you try spending a chunk of your life being beholden to those people for a paycheck. 

i at least have the benefit of working exclusively with adults; steam's user base has people younger than 13.i disagree. it's a very simple solution to not reuse passwords.

the only other thing i can think of doing to cut back on lost accounts is mandatory two step authentication, and use something like google's app for it.as an it tech, i don't care if it's opportune for normal people or not. the reality is that restoring access to an account after a breach is a colossal pain in the ass, and requires more steps than people seem to realize.

at least in my office, all we need is the employees id card to verify their identity. but that's not something valve has at their disposal, so the verification that an account belongs to who an individual says it does is just an arduous process. 

like i've said else where, i think the reason steam support sucks is because their ticket queue is full of people who lost their accounts due to their own stupidity. pedophiles and doxxers are upset because they're not allowed to be pedophiles and doxxers on reddit.most likely a networking bug. good on you, buddy!fucking lol.that's like saying it's too hard to tell kids not to take candy from strangers. 

and even if it is to hard, it's not valve's problem to fix.check out /r/themes. you can usually find something you can modify into what you need.hello! i run another sub with an alt-account, so if you need any help with figuring things out, let me know.then take steps to ensure your email, the skeleton key of everything you do online, has a different and harder to break password from everything else.you're thinking of indie pharma. indy pharma is eli lilly.it's on the top of a stryker, i know that much for certain.

less certain, it's some type of remote weapon station (rws), probably a common remote operated weapon system (crows) equipped with a mk.19 grenade launcher and smoke dispensers. the sight is, like /u/nofksgvn said, likely an infrared or thermal sight. 

[another flavor of a crows sporting an m2 .50cal.](http://media.defenceindustrydaily.com/images/ord_rws_crows_kongsberg_lg.jpg)

the model shown in the picture is a, i think, protector m151.first rule of passwords: never use the same password twice.

if your two step authentication email password is the same as your steam password, you're an idiot.don't click links from people you've never met in real life.

holy shit you'd think it's rocket science by how few people don't follow this rule.based solely on the content of most "steam support screwed me" threads, why do you think steam support is so slow?

my personal take has always been that its because of the shear volume of "not valve's problem" tickets. not the same issue. it's not valve's problem if you lose your shit because you installed a program or fell for a scam.because it doesn't hurt to put in the effort to nicely format things.oh, ok. so it being broadcast on itv rather than citv is a sign that it's not going to be aimed entirely at children.
truth be told i don't watch enough tv, or even any british tv, to understand the significance of itv.

what is special about itv?1) i'm stupidly excited by this. the original countdown was just *perfect*.

2) the animation is (thankfully) similar to that of star wars the clone wars, so it's fortunately pretty easy to stomach. i was pretty sure that the uncanny valley effect from the character pages had to do with the stillness and lighting, and it looks like i was right. edit: compare [this](https://igcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t51.2885-15/11055772_913126082041955_556603935_n.jpg) to [this](http://i.imgur.com/s8joaig.png) and it's pretty obvious. 

3) holy shit those models. as a kid, i wanted to work for companies like industrial light and magic and weta, so seeing *real, beautifully built models* is just so exciting that the story could be written by kanye west and i'd still watch for the models alone.

4) anyone else notice the space 1999 homage at 0:20?

5) it's very clear that the people in charge of this project have an intense love for the source material. it would be so easy to just make another 2004 film or a tonka rescue type cg series and call it a day. no, it's abundantly clear that the creators want to actually make a worthy successor to the originals. for that alone, i will absolutely watch all of the episodes. 

6) this is a kids show that manages to feel like it's not for kids. you can definitely tell that the creators had the older fans in mind as well. heck, i'd even contend that the show is *primarily* meant for the older fans, and the nature of the content just permits itself to be good for children. the only redeeming feature of that film was bill paxton.

it still loses points for casting paxton as jeff, though. is that the uscss nostromo? &gt; what if there was a simple conceptual "building block", and you could use this building block to solve a very large number of problems in machine learning. would you be interested in knowing what that building block is or where it comes from?

then the people who discover it are going to earn an absurd amount of money and probably a nobel prize. 

as it stands, the "basic building blocks" are discrete mathematics, statistics, set theory, and game theory. 

&gt; what algorithms are useful to ai? or if not algorithms, what is useful to you?

algorithms: [graph algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:graph_algorithms), [search algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:search_algorithms), dynamic programming, just about every algorithm typically used in computer science really. 

models: neural networks, k-means clustering, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, perceptrons, linear classifiers in general, bayesian networks, [etc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_machine_learning_concepts). 

math: algorithm design, first order logic, linear algebra, statistics and probability, set theory, game theory.

and good old fashioned pen and paper. computers are nice, but if a model or algorithm cannot be expressed on paper, something is horribly wrong. 

i can't share my machine learning class note, but my ai class notes are public available [here](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/cs47100/notes.html). that's all substantial work, and it will be useful, but i'm still not seeing past the fact that it's just a more efficient processor. if you were in /r/hardware, you'd be getting a lot of praise, but there's a reason why hardware and software people don't get each other all the time.

again, i'm not seeing how this would be any more useful to ai as a field than a faster processor. yes, it's a performance boost, but it doesn't actually solve any of our current problems.

&gt; why do you keep talking about the human brain?

op's article.&gt; it is really interesting that you hold computational steps above time and power (energy).

i disagree. moore's law has been fairly accurate over the past half century, and while we'll hit physical boundaries with the current system, there's no reason to think we won't establish other architectures to get past this. that's what i see your work as; a mechanism to bypass the physical limitations.

processing time and memory are cheap.

&gt; so lets say you have a quantum computer and you are trying to factor. are the computational steps still the same?

that's hitting some pretty graduate level stuff, but i feel very confident in saying "no". i couldn't tell you why, but that's my answer.

&gt; yes, i'm aware. 

well then you're aware of the problem. hardware optimization is essentially a brute force solution to the problem. ok, i'm going to disregard everything you've said and i'm going to focus on this one bit:

&gt;&gt; it'd be like taking a modern super computer back to 1965 and asking computer scientists from that era to create a program that can read handwriting in a digital image. those scientists, in short, would not be able to do it without substantial effort, largely because the ml algorithms that are used today did not exist back then.

&gt; you lost me. im not sure what you are arguing or how it applies to what we are doing. 

that highlights to me that our issue is that we're focusing on two totally unrelated fields of study. 

from what i understand, you're focusing "real" performance increase; reducing energy consumption and run time by reducing the number of cpu and io operations via dedicated hardware. this is great, but ultimately unrelated from the field of ai and computer science as a whole.

what you *need to do* to produce a truly breakthrough piece of hardware is find a way to reduce the number of steps in a given solution. we don't need to perform the set of steps faster, we need fewer steps. it's like comparing the amount of time you spend playing chess to the number of moves you make.

for example, it takes five steps to verify ((1+2)/3)*(2+5)=7:

1) (1+2) = 3

2) (3/3) = 1

3) (2+5) = 7

4) (1*7) = 7

5) 7=7

the number of steps the problem required is *mathematically constant*. sure, you can make the solution in the computer simpler and faster than a typical machine, but you still haven't solved our bigger problem.

our biggest problem is that we have been so far unable to establish *any* model that describes the brain's logic. it's completely disconnected from processing power; we flat out lack the math to solve the problem using our conventional toolkits. 

new hardware *does not solve this problem for us*. i can mathematically reduce a vision recognition algorithm on pen and paper; i cannot do anything remotely close to that with the human brain. i read the abstract.

you're looking at speed from a physics perspective, which isn't the same as how cs looks at it. 

from what i understand, this system yields improved *real time* performance and improved power consumption. what i don't see is a reduction in the number of computational steps, or a reduction of the algorithmic complexity of the solution. 

to us, those are the real measures. we don't care about run time or how much power we burn, rather we care about the number of algorithmic steps are required to solve a problem, and that measure is constant and agnostic of the architecture.

i take it you've seen big-o notation?funny you mention feynman, his work is largely what i'm drawing from when i'm trying to understand your own work. 

if i'm going to impart any information on you, it's going to be that in the ai field you should stop thinking about it in terms of computers. the vast majority of the work currently going on (deep learning, vision recognition, natural language processing, etc) is actually all just extensions of statistics and discrete mathematics. 

very little of the "exciting" research revolves around actual code or api's; those tend to be for the developers in charge of big data applications and not for actual researchers.

ultimately, i'd suggest tracking down a university professor who specializes in computer science, ai, and machine learning. i could sit here and try to tell you how we do things, but i'm honestly unsure of my own ability to do so (i'm just too knowledgeable to be confident). 

if you don't want to wait, you could also try watching stanford's andrew ng class on coursera. while by no means comprehensive, and even though it specifically focuses on *just* machine learning and not the full scopre of ai, it should give you a primer of just how much math is involved, and how little code/hardware matters.

https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning&gt; thats because this is new, and we are actively marketing it for the first time. its as if novelty is an argument for validity. is that what you are saying? 

no no, other way around. to me, novelty should be taken with a colossal grain of salt. that isn't to say that we don't need anything new, and i would even contend that the development of a true strong ai will necessitate at least some amount of novelty. 

but for every novel technology that gets adopted, ten more get left by the wayside. speaking from my incredibly limited understanding, i have no reason to believe that ahah-based computing will be the next major innovation in the field. 

&gt; i am curious why you think "the broad majority of ai applications it will go almost entirely unused".

well, recycling the random variable argument, it's just not very important in a majority of applications. i don't need a perfectly random number in most situations where a random number is called for; a number generated based on the clock of the cpu is sufficient. however, there are some cases where dedicated hardware is needed to produce truly random numbers, but that's typically seen only in the security fields, well outside of the norm. 

fitting that to our field, i don't need a strong ai to maintain my house, or drive my car, or even analyze my stock portfolio to make me a billion dollars. weak ai is, in my opinion, the far more useful of the two flavors, and a slime-mold like world of weak intelligences offer more utility than a handful of strong ai.

frankly, if the current solutions work, why replace them? memory and processor time is cheap, r&amp;d time isn't. i'm not saying all of future ai development should focus on weak ai, but i am contending that most of it will.

&gt; i can simulate kt-ram or other ahah processors (or whatever) with other computers.

and if you can simulate those devices using a contemporary computer, why can we not just cut the fat out and run whatever kt-ram or ahah processes we have on a normal computer architecture? i understand efficiency is a major consideration, but could we not just make sacrifices using some clever heuristics or probabilistic approaches?

&gt; can you back that up with physics? a typical cmos wire interconnect capacitance is .2ff/um and energy to charge is (1/2) c v2. give me the number of adaptive variables, resolution, address space and adaptation rates and crunch some numbers. at some some point physics is going to bite you. its really a matter of how many adaptive variables you think will be required.

no, i'm not a physicist. and while i agree with what you say (there *is* a lower bound for how efficient our hardware can be), i do not at this time believe that that is the limiting factor. you could build me the most wizbang computer architecture in the world, but if i can only make it do simple addition, everyone's time has been wasted.

the major issue to me, again, is that the logic that drives the brain is just too complex for us to understand, much less replicate. we understand so little about how the brain makes decisions that the idea that we can apply contemporary algorithms to a wizbang computer architecture and magically produce a strong ai just seems laughable to me. 

it'd be like taking a modern super computer back to 1965 and asking computer scientists from that era to create a program that can read handwriting in a digital image. those scientists, in short, would not be able to do it without substantial effort, largely because the ml algorithms that are used today did not exist back then.

one of the axioms of contemporary software engineering is "solve the problem first, optimize second". my entire argument here has been that *we haven't even solved the problem*, and that kt-ram and ahah is simply premature optimization. if we don't even have a rough idea of what the solution looks like, how the heck do we optimize it and make it run faster?like i said, i'm wrapping up my undergrad. i'm only speaking from my limited understanding. that's some fascinating research, but i'm still not sold. even more concerning to me, however, is that this is the first i've heard of this research, and i'm wrapping up my undergrad in cs focusing on ai at a rather well known university.

keeping it short and sweet, i'm seeing very little reason to believe that this technology will be any different from dedicated true random coprocessors in their application. for a handful of specific applications, yeah, it'll be incredibly useful. but for the broad majority of ai applications it will go almost entirely unused.

this is, of course, sort of just an expansion of turing's ideas. the question isn't whether or not the machine is intelligent, it's whether or not the machine *acts* intelligently. these ahah chips may be able to produce honestly intelligent machines, while traditional hardware may just produce intelligent acting machines. and again, i believe that this is 100% ascertainable using traditional hardware technologies, and believe that this is the far more important avenue of research. 

maybe it's just the inner engineer in me, but it seriously strikes me that this research is nothing more than a really cool project that ultimately won't have much use outside of a lab. i thought the paper would be something else.

in short, you're exactly right. from a hardware perspective, the major problem is that no computer we've built functions the way the brain does. like it or not, organic brains just aren't based on turing machines.

the major problem, however, is that this type of hardware is still a long way away. with our current computers, the logic is pretty straight forward and draws heavily on the past few hundred years of computers and computational engines.

but the brain? we still barely understand how it works, and that's being *very* generous. just because we can use optical fibers doesn't mean we're any closer to a computer analogous to the brain from a hardware standpoint.

which is why i'll stand by what i said; the software and algorithms are the bottleneck. i suspect the first "smart ai" will be the product of sophisticated algorithms, not a new computer architecture.oh right, they were.

i'm confusing my games. ~~well, i mean, why do you think it was 50gb?~~

~~gotta put all those textures somewhere.~~

then again, i also listen to muse, draft punk, jungle, gorillaz, mc frontalot, big data, and about 100 other artists of all types without acting like an uncultured fuckwit. 

maybe it's just assholes who get elitist about music?except anyone in the ai field will tell you that it has nothing to do with the hardware. 

hardware is easy, the algorithms and software are very, *very* hard.

i don't agree, but it depends on how you want to read into it. no, what he's trying to imply is that congress members are not "unauthorized persons". i mean, isn't this why george e. p. box's quote gets thrown around all the time?

but my grandfather was the chief engineer for the satsop project, and sometime in 2011 (i believe) we went and walked around what's left of the facility. 

i don't know what the current plan is, but i've heard rumors of them turning the towers into hotels, others of using them as audio-acoustic laboratories and recording studios, some as a theme park, and still others as a children's soccer field. jobs don't give a rats ass about gpa if you can demonstrate you're competent.

i actually know quite a few incompetent people with close to 4.0 gpas, too. all a gpa is good for is showing you can get a good gpa. well if you're in the us, you won't notice anything with default settings. 

from what i recall, f.lux only starts adjusting the color of your monitor at sundown (it's based on your timezone and the actual sundown time). there should be a setting somewhere that lets you default the color change to always be on. i'm 99% sure it's just a streaming device. at that price point, it's pretty difficult to get anything else out of it."sure, we'll go with that."

-programmeri would think they'd do the same thing as f.lux. rather than dropping $200 on a set of glasses, just try that?

though the only righteous bison i've ever bought from weta got cut into pieces for another build, so i guess i'm not even taking the "dont spend money" advise. depends on what metric you're looking to use.

[pictures here](https://steamdb.info/blog/valve-at-gdc-expo/)by the way, which one *is* pink?not a sequel. it's a stand-alone "expansion". it's not going to be as big as tno was. man am i excited about this!i wonder if reddit has the ability to differentiate between "sovereign" and "rogue".not the same arg. when people refer to args in reference to half life, we're talking more about everything that happened when portal 2 was announced; decrypting radio signals, digging through web page source code, morse code, etc.i'd watch the shit out of that.&gt; instead, i told the truth. that demonstrates honesty. he should at least consider that i was doing the right thing.

*only because it benefited you to do so*. now your psychologist knows that not only are you *willing to lie for drugs*, you'll drop whatever it is you were saying in a heartbeat if you thought it would benefit you. again, this is only helping the case that you are a shoe in for an aspd diagnosis.

&gt; i might not be able to get him to reverse the diagnosis, but i can probably get someone else to disagree. i can probably convince a few others as well. there's always a supply of new unexperienced psychiatrists to choose from.

for fuck sake, look before you fucking leap. the reason you're in this mess in the first place is because you've consistently failed to grasp the consequences of what you're doing.

*if you seek a second opinion, it's very likely you're going to get another aspd diagnosis*. your first psychologist saw through the charade of adhd and (correctly) diagnosed you with aspd. now you're planning on going to another psychologist and... trying to tell them that you don't think you have aspd?

psychologists *are not stupid*, they're going to see through that. the second you open your mouth to a second psychologist, they're going to see right through what you have to say and double down on the aspd diagnosis. 

in fact, psychologists are one of the few groups who it is incredibly hard to lie to. they're *looking for lies and deceit*, and unlike your college professors, are very good at detecting it. 

&gt; i can get 100k easily with a degree in cs and specialisation in security.

assuming you didn't lie your way through your work and cheat at everything you did, sure. based on the amount of lying and shortcuts you've taken, i highly doubt you're at all competent in the field of cs. 

this shit *will* come up to haunt your future, and you're going to regret ever taking short cuts.then you get to shell out the (i think) $250 for a gdc yearly pass to access the vaults. no, hl2 was first showcased at e3 2003.&gt; this is why i need to get him to claim that the diagnosis was a mistake. if he does this, and i claim that i legitimately thought that i have adhd then no one's going to suspect anything.

couple things.

1) you *admitted* to your psychologist that you lied to him. *that is further evidence that you are afflicted with aspd*. no self-respecting professional is going to turn back on their professional opinion just because you ask them to, especially when it's so obvious that they're right.

2) you've claimed you're in cs, so i'll explain it this way: medical records are source controlled much like git. every time something is changed in your record, it's saved for future analysis. the key difference is that you *cannot go back and selectively delete changes*. long term medical diagnosis sometimes rely on old changes, even if they are believed to be erroneous. that aspd diagnosis will remain in the record until you die.

*the dod will get those records whether you want them to or not.* even more so, assuming you're somehow cunning enough to get the psychologist to reverse the aspd diagnosis, the dod will *still* see the old aspd diagnosis, and will likely begin to investigate.

*it does not matter if you think you can get the psychologist to reverse the decision!* you've made your bed, and you're going to sleep in it.

&gt; i can follow rules if i want.

no, you can't. you were expected to follow the department of defense's rules, and you didn't. now your entire world is crashing down around you all because you didn't put in the minimum legitimate effort to do what was expected of you and didn't follow the rules.

you can chose to believe that you're above rules all you want, but that $100,000 bill is still going to be your responsibility. heh, my reference was to thunderbird 1 as well. yeah i'll get in on this. best case scenario, half-life 3 and $5. practicing psychologists (the ones that can prescribe medication) hold the same mds as any other doctor. they're not your generic undergrad psych majors you meet in school. 

&gt; dod intelligence depends on which branch i think.

branch is totally irrelevant. if your scholarship depends on passing a background check, and that background check includes the status of your mental health, *you're fucked*. 

even better, *you don't get patient confidentiality*. the dod will either get that information, or it will strip you of your scholarship on the grounds that you refuse to voluntarily hand the information over. you're dammed if you tell them, dammed if you don't.

&gt; but if a person, especially in technology, gives up 6 figures to work at government wages, he probably isn't too intelligent.

*or* they want to work for their country. and *those* are the people who you need to be afraid of; they're the people who will not hesitate to make your life a living hell if you so much as sneeze on the rule book. 

lastly, i highly suggest that you [*read the dsm-5 for aspd*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisocial_personality_disorder#dsm-5). i'll even bold the sections that apply to you.

&gt; a) a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others, occurring since age 15 years, as indicated by three or more of the following:
&gt; &gt; 1. **failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest;**
&gt; &gt; 2. **deception, as indicated by repeatedly lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure;**
&gt; &gt; 3. **impulsivity or failure to plan ahead;**
&gt; &gt; 4. irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults;
&gt; &gt; 5. reckless disregard for safety of self or others;
&gt; &gt; 6. **consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations;**
&gt; &gt; 7. lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.

based *solely on what you have written alone*, you're a perfect fit for requirements 1,2,3, and 6, as well as a loose fit for requirements 5 and 7. 

you meet between *4/3 to 6/3 of the requirements for an aspd diagnosis*. i really have to applaud your psychologist's ability to so accurately diagnose you when you were actually *trying to fake adhd*. exactly how stupid do you think the dod and your psychologist are?search joe braun in the directory and he comes back as vp of hr. where are you getting your info?[via steamdb.info's page on the gdc:](https://steamdb.info/blog/valve-at-gdc-2015/)

&gt; **livestreams:**

&gt; according to gamespot no valve talks will be broadcasted by them during gdc. they say it's unlikely they'll be broadcast at all. we'll have to rely on people on the ground. videos of the talks will be available in the (paid) gdc vault after gdc.

incredibly important side-note: live streaming is not the same thing as live blogging. that's true, there are. but i've consistently found l/xl to be what i need, and i'm not inclined to try on a t-shirt. the pool below also slides away.it really just seems like valve got sick of people perpetually asking them to do something about scammers and are just nuking hyperlinks in general. 

don't quite know what you guys expected. "tent effect", basically. a large isn't long enough but has the perfect waist dimension, but an xl is long enough but suffers from a huge waist.

it's a colossal pain in the ass. it's not being announced in a "hey, buy our stuff!" way. the objective is to give other developers a taste of the equipment they're working on in the hope that they will lend assistance to their projects. 

the gdc is not meant for consumers, like i said. it's an industry conference and it's geared for their peers. it's a very safe bet that everything we see at the gdc is in a non-finished state.

official announcements for consumers tend to come around gamescom, pax, and e3. there is a way to get streams via the gdc website, but you have to pay for a gdc pass, and it's a pretty hefty cost.

like i said, the videos will be uploaded to their website sometime after the conference is over. that's when everyone who isn't a primary developer gets access. this opinion helps nobody except your own ego. no.

the gdc is a conference tailored specifically for *developers*, not consumers. these are basically lectures, not announcements. 

the gdc will post the talks on their website at a later date, but likely not until the conference is over. 

furthermore, valve isn't officially announcing anything. they're giving talks on things like physics in video games and the use of glnext in game engines. uh...

that... *may* have been how it was when i was in 252? i'm not 100% sure, it's been a while, but i vaguely remember having access to a test script that we could use during development.

i don't really call that an auto-grader, though. part of 252 is teaching you how to do things like unit tests, so the test scripts were sort of a primer in how those work. i'm tall enough that i have to wear size l for length alone, and depending on the brand of shirt, xl to compensate for shrinking in a drier.

but fuck me, right? 

(this is specifically about male shirts)&gt; and the videos from the sessions won't be available until after the conference.from what i understand, they are. that said, i think even devs need to purchase a pass every year. bigger reason: most countries outside of north america and japan tend to play pc, not console. i love how you're being downvoted despite being 100% correct. 

guys, the gdc is a developer event, not a consumer event. valve is essentially at the gdc giving lectures, not advertising their products. 

you can't view live broadcasts without purchasing a (rather hefty) developer pass, and the videos from the sessions won't be available until after the conference.

edit: for those curious, [this](http://media.steampowered.com/apps/valve/2013/mabrashgdc2013.pdf) is a gdc talk. well for compiler's i'd expect that.

we didn't use an autograder in 354, though. it was all graded by the ta's hand. this is typically common only in the lower levels. 

once i got past 240, i never worked with an auto-grader. &gt; oculus rift doesn't even have a working consumer version yet.

by design, yes. 

the gdc tends to be a little more closed to the public than other events. sometime after the conference, they'll post the presentations, but not for some period of time.

remember, the gdc is meant for *developers*. very little is going to go towards the general public in a consumption sense. these talks will be quite technical compared to pax, e3, or rtx. what exactly do you think astronauts do on their 7+ hour spacewalks?

the absolutely joke about that shit. even in the dramatization of apollo 13 they make jokes about it ("the great constellation ur-ine"). &gt; i have done some internships here and there and was wondering what i might actually learn at purdue?

hoooo boy. 

don't worry, it was a damn good joke. 

to be fair, that's a gameplay decision. carmack tended to not make those. no, this is a reddit thing in general. keep tabs on /r/subredditdrama, and you'll see a lot of people deleting their accounts to avoid (well deserved) shit storms.

happens everywhere, and it's pretty common. i don't give a flying fuck about what facebook owns, i'm sticking with the pc god; john carmack.

http://ourworldindata.org/data/food-agriculture/human-height/

/u/alexander1701's response is pretty much the only correct response. so, did you actually *read* the piece?

1) it's an opinion piece, ergo not a primary source

2) a lack of the reiteration of an nfu policy does not mean that china has abandoned it altogether. and anyone who uses an encyclopedia for information on events less than a few years old is an idiot. ok, so, i'm about to rock your world here:

*encyclopedias are never meant to be used as primary sources*. doesn't matter if it's ask.com, wikipedia, or encyclopedia britannica, encyclopedia's are meant to be used as predecessors to primary research. by design, encyclopedia's are meant to be simplified presentations of information.

ideally, when learning about a topic, you use an encyclopedia to get a breadth-first understanding of what you're trying to learn about. it would be counterproductive to read through every primary document if i just wanted to know about wwii. thus, you rely on something that gives you a brief understanding of what you're trying to learn (an encyclopedia), and then once you have established that base information, you can go out and track down primary and secondary sources. 

this, of course, comes at a cost, namely a lack of in depth information, and a large number of factual errors when compared to primary sources. this is true for *all* encyclopedias, and the fact that wikipedia has managed to remain comparable to volumes like encyclopedia britannica actually says quite a bit.

so to say wikipedia has factual errors is flat out unsurprising. it's an *encyclopedia*; any decent academic knows that it's an error prone document. lemme guess, something about ethics in games journalism?it's a mcflurry, the bar is really low.joe braun *is* the vp of human resources here at purdue. 

check for yourself: https://www.itap.purdue.edu/directory/oh no, absolutely, shit should've been dealt with post-war. oak ridge got more care than hanford did, and it was less dangerous to begin with. i want to point out that there was a very particular mentality behind hanford, beyond just greed.

a lot of the problem stems from the facts that:

a) there was a war on, and safety was generally less important than beating the nazis and japanese.

b) we didn't have a particularly strong appreciation for what it is that we had to store. at first, much of that material was handled the same way any other toxic material is handled, which isn't enough for radioactive waste.

ucil was all about money plain and simple. your lack of self awareness is absurd.

&gt; &gt; no, the whole of china is typically better now than it was under communism. even the less savory parts.

&gt; maoism. marx would have hardly called china at any point communist.

you started this battle of concrete definitions, not me. sure. but are you also going to go out of your way discussing how germany isn't an oligarchy, or a plutocracy, or a democracy?
which had literally nothing to do with communism. yet somehow, here we are arguing about how the public can't understand the difference between soviet socialism, maoism, and marxist communism.this entire conversation is irrelevant!!! it's a segue from a segue in a conversation about the german public!i suddenly remember why i hate other pro-socialist and pro-communist individuals.

call the us a democracy, nobody bats an eye. call the ussr/china communist, and everyone loses their goddamn minds.my [machina](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/machina) says otherwise. so then you brought nothing to the conversation with the first comment. 

just like how it's equally useless to say that the us isn't a democracy, it's a republic. it adds nothing of particular value to the conversation, and is basically just noise. marx would have hardly called the ussr communist. unless your dick was ferrous, i don't think you'd feel anything. it's the reflections of her skin/hair. it's all too shiny. yeah i missed the sarcasm. i think i was, too.and i enjoyed the forced subjugation of american indians, the civil war, and the 1960 race riots.

i'm not talking about history, i'm talking about now. no, the whole of china is typically better now than it was under communism. even the less savory parts.you're pretty young aren't you?district 9: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nmuqr72aee

elysium: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgwpozv9dcs*good*.

alien 3 suffered from a remarkably lazy story, and alien: resurrection was just not any good at all. alien 3's plot regarding the xeno itself was basically just a "this is the same creature we've always fought, but lets do it again for more $$$", and resurrection's character development was just flat out shit. 

i want to see elements of alien 3 and resurrection taken from those films and reworked into a new, better story for this film. i want the company to be the biggest bad guy (from resurrection), but i liked the desperation and finality of alien 3 in ripley's death.how is it possible for something to actually *sound* german?i was going to say the same. spats are a good look, and i'd like to see those return to the uniform. we know, there have been threads about both kxbm and desert singles all week.oh no, absolutely. the vast majority of redditor's interactions with cops wont extend beyond a routine traffic stop. 

but from a pure probability standpoint, i think they're right. yes you can, you just need to jump through hoops to do it. police should be allowed to use the same equipment the public can use. if i can buy an automatic ar-15 and body armor, so can the police.did you not learn about the cold war in school?

a backdoor is only dangerous when you are unaware of its existence. same goes for design of pretty much everything used in warfare, too: weakness are always present, and the logistics of how something is used always includes how to deal with weaknesses.

any electronic security expert worth their salt knows which technologies to avoid for extremely sensitive systems. &gt; how are they going to continue spying, if anyone with a tech background refuses to work for them on moral grounds?

by recruiting us. all you need to do is bring an enigma machine to the cs department and you have people lining up to talk to them. i would know, *i've watched it happen*.

&gt; such embarrassment increases oversight pressure, limiting said agency's freedom to operate, as well - if no-one in congress or on the intelligence committee believes them or takes their claims at face value, it's a lot harder to rubber-stamp 99% of their requested operations, as happened for a long time in the uncontested secret fisa courts - there's now talk of including a previously non-existent "people's advocate" in those courts which could limit operational approval even further. (something that should have been in place from day one, demonstrating the woeful lack of actual nsa oversight.)

you, i, and congress all know that absolutely nothing will come of this outrage. there will be no added oversight, because congress was the ones who gave the nsa this power in the first place.i still don't get this "embarrassment" thing. why would an agency capable of spying on every person on earth give a flying shit about being embarrassed? you misread my point:

the nsa could have said the truth, and nobody would believe them. the public *expects* clandestine agencies to *lie*, and so the focus becomes "catching them in lies".

you want to have a *real* conspiracy? how likely do you think it is that the nsa/cia and other agencies use these public statements as a means of misdirection, so that the public focuses on something they think is important while the nsa focuses on something else entirely.

hell, how can you independently verify that edward snowden isn't just an elaborate distraction crafted by the nsa to throw off the scent of what they actually do?

edit: you people mistake our lack of trust for snowden as a mark of trust for the nsa. the reality is that nobody in this subreddit trusts *either* of them. oh all of that is significant. but it's all exactly what the nsa was built to do. 

the nsa is a *signals intelligence agency*, they're one of the largest employers of computer scientists, mathematicians, and technical individuals in the world, and everything you just described is exactly what i expect from a clandestine sigint agency. 

&gt; it must really suck for nsa employees to be told that they cannot read about the revelations online. it must really suck to have your thoughts and activity controlled by your employer to such a degree that simply reading the news is against policy.

i have very little faith that anyone in the nsa takes that seriously. you're telling me that an organization who's *written job* is to gather intelligence and know *everything* would take steps to *not know something?*

also, and this is an aside, but the cia does drone work, not the nsa. the nsa provides intel, the cia pulls the trigger. again, not exactly a huge revelation that the cia does ethically questionable shit.

look, both agencies are "evil" *because we designed them that way*. it's not far off from "mad man" theory in its application. the objective is to make anyone who is less than friendly with the us think twice about screwing with us because we have a collection of agencies who would not hesitate to make them and their family disappear. whether or not that would actually happen is a moot point, part of the objective is to *make people think* that that's what will happen.

the nsa gets more flak, though, because the technologies that the "bad guys" use are the exact same as the ones we use here at home. if russia used something analogous but distinct from the technologies we used, you could be damn sure that those would have priority. 

but because russia *also* uses vpn, ssh, and ssl, it makes sense for the nsa to crack *those technologies*.edit: scratch all that.

if a document shows the nsa doing something clandestine, and that they are liars, why would the public believe what the nsa has to say to begin with?ok, let's cut all of the bullshit. the nsa is evil, and frankly i'm not in the mood to go and disagree.

so let's just keep this simple: *why should i trust edward snowden, and how do i verify that the information he releases is not influenced by him and greenwald's publicly stated biases?*

answer that in a concrete way and i'll forever renounce my shill ways. &gt; yet you seem to be completely accepting of the information spoonfed to you by usgov.

no, i fucking don't. i don't trust *either side* because nobody has allowed me to independently verify the information. the only major difference is that i *know* the united states is up to clandestine and ethically dubious shit, while eddy snowden is trying to paint himself as a saint and a martyr. 

&gt; demands to release the entirety of the nsa's secret documents so that nsa can craft a single response to discredit them, rather than be humiliated by being caught in lie after lie as they try to discredit each individual release, check.

how would having access to the entirety of the leak somehow strengthen the nsa's argument? fucking answer me that. 

&gt; after what snowden just told us regarding intra-agency emails literally telling nsa's employees what to believe, what talking points to reinforce, and how to interpret the news, your behavior makes perfect sense.

and for all we know, there were other emails telling people that the guy who sent the ones you mentioned was fired and to ignore what he said! i'm not saying that that is the case, but you are literally succumbing to a bias and are blind to it! if this were vaccines, you'd be on my side!

&gt; because i can and have verified, for myself

no you have not! independent verification *includes examining the problem from the opposing side!* you took snowden's argument hook line and sinker and never once stopped to think "maybe i should get the nsa's side on this!"

&gt; currently, to me, the nsa is the organization that triggered vietnam,

what the fuck? have you *been* in a history classroom?

are you actually capable of forming an independent argument, or are you only capable of parroting the same quotes that get posted to /r/til every week?

you wanna play the "barely relevant quotes" game? ok, fine.

&gt; "the people can always be brought to the bidding of edward snowden. that is easy. all you have to do is tell them they are being watched and denounce the skeptics for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. it works the same way in any country."

the reason why *i personally* do not trust edward snowden and glenn greenwald is because it is so blatantly obvious that they went into this with an axe to grind. snowden wasn't a die-hard patriot when he joined the nsa, and even stated publicly that he [planned on leaking nsa information prior to even working for them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edward_snowden#political_views). glenn greenwald is cut from the same cloth as well, and before these leaks wrote articles denouncing the us left and right.

but what *really* gets me is that *nobody except for snowden and greenwald* know how much information was in that leak, and even worse, we don't know what information they've chosen to omit from leaking.  they've stated time and again that greenwald and snowden are solely in charge of *selecting which documents to release*, allegedly to "protect the lives of undercover agents".

do you *actually believe* that that is why they haven't released the whole thing? because i don't. i have very little reason to not believe that if snowden and greenwald found documents that painted the us and nsa in a good light, they would not release it. and why would they?

assume you have 10,000 documents, 5,000 show the nsa is a bad guy, and 5,000 show the nsa is a good guy. if you hated the nsa prior to getting your hands on these documents, would you release the documents showing they were good?

no, you wouldn't, not unless you had a very strong moral compass. i think chelsea manning had a strong compass, but i do not believe snowden does. 

putting it succinctly, i don't trust snowden and greenwald because *i cannot verify, for myself, exactly what was in that leak*. all i get is the information that is selected and spoonfed to me, and i have little reason to believe that i'm getting anything other than a biased opinion. sounded like a nazi.yeah but which is statistically more likely? meeting a bad cop or a member if isis? 

i hate agreeing with reddit, but i think their numbers check out for once on this.so far. and the last one was quite a while ago. i sorta think they've run out of juicy things to reveal.if it's granite management, don't even bother. they'll charge you for it anyway and clean it again. i have no clue. all i know is that the whois for kxbm is not the same as the one for bmrf. 

the only thing in kxbm's favor (at the moment) is that the server is actually hosted in phoenix. bmrf.us may resolve to that owner, but kxbm does not.

if this is the lone survivor 2299 guy, i'm going to personally shove a railspike down his throat. morse code is one of the things he fucked us with.what's your parachute mod for the kerbal?isn't it because the spy walks with his right shoulder forward? he always leads with his right hand, like almost every other spy depicted in movies. i love his lack of helmet. i laughed.i'm heavily reminded of echelon.people hire lawyers because the law is incredibly complex and nuanced and to fully understand it takes years of education. 

common sense, frankly, isn't.kv-2s are great because you have a nice, big, flat target to hit.

plus, they store the ammo in the turret, and they struggle to traverse horizontally when the tank is sitting on an incline.

that said, that howitzer is frightening to be on the receiving end of. honestly? none of them. part of what i love about the thunderbirds was the quaint 60s take on all of the tech in their world, and the '04 film threw it out the window. 

with this new series, it seems like those designs are coming back, and with it some of the soul of the show.i'm being a cheeky bastard, but what both /u/tyggerjai and /u/ddrcoder said.

you need a strong basis in both linear algebra and statistics and probability. linear algebra is useful for making the models themselves, statistics and probability are useful for determining what to actually focus on from a data standpoint, and for selecting heuristics.the major reason why half-life 3 is still in development is because valve is:

a) incredibly devoted to not releasing something until it has been done *right*.

b) not stupid enough to hand the most important franchise in their history to another developer.
as someone who focused in machine intelligence in undergrad, this makes me very happy. jeez... though i suppose that that is a solution to the problem of spent casings cluttering the vehicle up. area 51 is part of the nellis air force range. they're all over ebay. i'm more freaked out by the front rack on either the m-22 locust or m-24 chaffee. i don't know who the hell thought stowing all of the ammo in the front of a light tank was a good idea, but i'd bet they cost a lot of lives. heh, yep. i'm actually a pretty avid war thunder player, so i think that's why i remember certain t-34s being death traps. 

that said, while the germans seemed to have their shit together about not clustering all of the ammo in a single place, they didn't seem to really vary the locations of the racks, even between chassis.

shooting from the side, i always tend to aim just between the turret and driver's seat on the main hull, and i have a pretty decent chance of hitting an ammo load. 

that said, some of the shermans have pretty weird ammo rack placements, too. i seem to remember the soviets had a similar problem with certain variants of t-34's, too. the ammunition would be stored below the turret in basically a wall-to-wall rack, and densely packed to boot.smart move, but now it really makes me wonder if the rounds are store inside the hull and the propellant has to pass through an external door to get to the breech. if that's the case, then that means for every round fired, the vehicle opens some sort of hatch to the outside to get the propellant.

like i said before, bizarro design decision in vehicles designed during the cold war. 

edit: apparently, both the projectile and the propellant are store in a revolver mechanism under the gun. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtzobtvjqpsi thought that, too, but it looks like something is already inserted into the breach before the flash happens. hey, that's pretty much my domain. not a huge shock as to why i'd like cmu over stanford. it's just a different type of people, imo. i like pittsburgh quite a bit, it's an industrial city with a abnormally vibrant art presence. i'm more a fan of that than i am of california in general. what was that flash of white light? there isn't a hatch that opens during loading, is there?

that'd be a stupid design decision from a cbrn perspective. congrats!

this is actually my last semester in cs, so i've basically survived the program. if you've got any particular questions, feel free to shoot them to me.

but purdue cs is actually very good, and we compare quite well to schools like cmu and stanford for undergraduate programs. beyond academics, we've got a pretty strong corporate recruiting presence, too, with just about every major cs company in the world competing for your attention.

if you're interested in the class requirement for the program, you can take a gander [here](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/undergraduate/curriculum/bachelor.html). you're required to take a set of core classes (things covering algorithms, oo-programming, and computer architecture), and then choose a concentration of study at the end of your sophomore year. personally, i was in cs concentrating in machine intelligence, which was basically focusing on ai, machine learning, web search, and statistics. 

the only thing i will warn you about, though, is that purdue is one of the hardest grading schools in the nation. personally, i think that's a good thing, though this has come as a hit to my gpa. purdue students tend to laugh at the gpas from other schools because we're all pretty bummed by how much grade inflation everyone else benefits from. i'd choose carnegie over stanford, personally. i disagree, but solely for undergraduate education as you're typically living either on campus or just off of it, so you're fairly insulated from the surrounding area.

i live in west lafayette a block from purdue, and it's very different from the surrounding lafayette area. turning down a cs degree from cmu because it's in pittsburgh is probably the stupidest thing you could ever do in this field. 

it's like turning down a degree from mit because people say "chowda". looks an awful lot like a hole punched in tank armor. you're a monster. i do too, but all the same the re-write of her character heavily suggests that security is going to be a bigger concern this time around.

heck, they've even given her her own thunderbird vehicle. if that doesn't say "we're turning this up to 11", i don't know what does. you can own them as pets, but you need to get a bunch of permits from, like, the usda and the epa.

way too much effort for a tank pet. i'm wondering if this is why kayo/tin-tin's character has been basically rewritten. rather than being a technician for the thunderbird fleet, she's now the head of ir's security. 

they never had a security officer before, so perhaps it's going to play an even more significant role this time around. you've literally never read the books and you're willing to say something is shit?tintin is a blonde man, tin tin is an asian womanwell, we'll see, especially now that blomkamp has officially been given the go-ahead from fox. god among men, sir.i'm 100% certain she did, i just wouldn't be able to tell you which one. 
because she's a female?tin tin was in part responsible for technology and equipment maintenance and worked under brains' instruction. in the show, she may not have done anything, but behind the scenes in the universe, she absolutely did. thunderbirds came much later than the adventures of tintin. 

also, tintin is an international treasure, you watch your mouth. that franchise is cut from a similar clothe as the thunderbirds.dude, bitching about how uncomfortable things are is about half of what we cosplayers do. 

hell, swing by the 405th and ask how many people have been jabbed in the dick but rough-cut fiberglass, and you'll wonder why there isn't a support group.

it comes with the turf. hola's not working for me, could we get a mirror?and that's great.

this is just the wrong sub for it. you might be in the wrong sub if you can't sympathize with other cosplayers struggles.and frankly nobody cares. "i'm going to be pedantic about definitions and completely ignore colloquial english!"

-everyone who has ever brought up the "macs are pcs too" argument ever. 

even people who work with computers don't do this. source: i work it and study cs. "if i can do it, so can you!" is much better than "you might be fucked, you might not be. who knows?"my pbj-1h is in desperate need of gun sights, the 75mm would be so much more fun to use with one!

could very well be inspired by them. i said *one of a few*. as a whole, the patriot act is a piece of shit, but that doesn't mean that someone didn't slip in at least one reasonable thing.

prior to 2001, our intelligence agencies *could not share information*. if the cia knew something, they couldn't tell the fbi or nsa. if the nro was able to figure something out, the cia would need to figure it out for themselves. 

compartmentalizing our intelligence makes no sense. &gt; (not jinxing)

you fucked us!

seriously, though, daredevil and jessica jones both look rather promising. daredevil in particular almost feels like a direct response to arrow, and i seriously hope it's as good. i'd be all about it. marvel needs to really beef up their television presence in both the animated and live action department. 

not that i'm a company-war kinda guy, but dc is kicking their ass at it. arrow, the flash, smallville, gotham, the entirety of wb animated shorts and tv shows, etc. 

all marvel really has is agents of shield, agent carter, and a handful of rather crummy animated shows for kids. i would absolutely love to see some improved shows. agreed. it wasn't a terribly huge shock that there would be two villains, one being lesser than the other, but the mandarin's portrayal was stellar considering the tonal differences in the mcu. 

going with the classic chinese magician guy would've been extremely hard to do. [yes, she's flying something called the shadow](http://40.media.tumblr.com/faf48899c817f17c9e0fa093f51a420a/tumblr_nimygxdxhp1t7mcjdo1_1280.jpg).

one of the very few good things to come out of the patriot act. advances in breadth and depth first search algorithms and heuristics you say?

fascinating, here i was thinking that an availability heuristic is about the simplest heuristic you can use, and it's not exactly like depth and breadth first search in trees is a new concept, either. 

huge advance in theory, i must say.care to enlighten me, then? if you're so well aware, it should be easy to explain.i hope you have a good day, dude. that was needlessly philosophical. 

there are currently 7+ billion human brains on this rock, and countless other organic brains in animals of various shapes and sizes. the idea that we couldn't figure out how to reproduce just one of those is, to me, laughable.

the major reason why humans have gotten as far as we have is because we never figure anything out with just one mind. instead, we have teams of scientists and engineers working to solve a single problem, all working together to provide a pool of intellect greater than any one person. 

maybe "a" brain couldn't figure out how the brain works, but i'm damn sure a bunch of brains and a few computers will.that is correct and a much better summary of what i'm trying to say.because "computers" is somewhat broad term, especially when we're relating then to our brain. our brain is a computer running with a very different set of rules than that of a turing machine.

when people say "computers don't compare to the human brain", it's incredibly important to include the caveat "yet". there's absolutely no reason to assume that we could not someday build a computer that closely matches how the human brain works that could surpass our own in its capabilities.

that said, i've always been of the mind that if i want a brain like computer, i'd have a child.that's correct, but our brain is just a type of computer distinct from the type we work with. rather than algorithmically arriving at a solution, our brain uses a whole bunch of clever techniques and heuristics to do so faster on certain problems. 

the major issue is that our method of problem solving isn't provable or consistent; it's different between individual brains, whereas an algorithmic approach is reproducible in the steps it takes on every computer.

this isn't to say we couldn't build a computer or machine that approaches problems the same way; it's just much much harder for us to build a machine that could do it. well each core still round robins the workload (there can be hundreds of concurrent processes in a given moment), you just reduce the number of processes per core by something like 1/4 or 1/2.if that were true, our brains wouldn't work.there's literately nothing a chess computer does that a human couldn't do. the only difference is that humans are far slower.

all computers do is follow a set of rules developed by humans, and faster than a human could follow the same set of rules.it took computers a long time because humans had to design the algorithm the computers used to play the game.

machines didn't figure out how to best chess, we did.i feel this is a tad disingenuous; computers do whatever their built to do extremely well, we just don't understand how our own brains work well enough to reproduce them.

assuming we could figure out the specifics of how our brains worked, we should be able to improve upon the design and produce a superior version. 

instead, we work with turing machine type computers because that's been the most reliable thing we've been able to come up with.to add onto this, concurrency in a computer (multi tasking or doing two things at once) is actually an illusion.

what is actually happening is that the processor alternates between different processes very fast in a round robin fashion, each taking turns doing calculations. 

when you kill a program, you basically just instruct the processor to forget that the process even existed so that it stops letting it run calculations. fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy, fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy; fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy fallacy.

reddit.man, you just have a lot of pent up rage coursing through you.you could always just hit it with the broad stroke of the fallacy fallacy.you're a godsend, sir.could someone get a mirror up for us americans?got to it via hola.

anyone else sorta concerned that the hood seems to actually know the thunderbird's names? does this mean they're not going to bring back operation coverup?

this is an absolutely fascinating amalgam of techniques. the hood and holograms are all cgi, but the set is a real model, and it actually *looks* good. 

amazing. now i know how non-americans feel.

feels bad, man. http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/trooper_helmet

pump your brakes, kid. atomic platters, a man after my own heart.i don't consider colonial marines canon. 

but even if it was, it doesn't explain how ripley is alive. either this ripley will be another clone (which i doubt), or she gets short-term amnesia between aliens and alien 3, where this film could take place. 

the simplest thing to do is retcon alien 3 and resurrection. i'd *love* some external ordinance for the 38s. i already eat up just about every other aircraft in the skies, and external weaponry would absolutely ensure total air and ground dominance. weird, you'd think they'd have a better budget.

i'm a senior cs undergrad, and the nsa routinely comes to our building with a whole bunch of tools and toys. two years ago they brought one of the original enigma machines and let people play with them.'sup, /u/autowikibot. no, i'm not. powers that be will always take steps to ensure that they remain in power. it's a massive mistake to assume that *only* the us will do an unethical thing, where other 1st world nations would not.

[via der spiegel](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/spiegel-reveals-cooperation-between-nsa-and-german-bnd-a-909954.html)

also, it's not like germany has a [history of doing similar shit.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stasi)the original fallouts were gory in a sort of 90's cinema sort of way. while the graphics aren't as good as 3 and new vegas', they had the benefit of being entirely rendered and animated before hand. 

now, all deaths are procedurally generated, so while each gory explosion is unique to the kill, they blend together in your memory as being samey. i grabbed a random country out of my ass? i could've said vietnam or france or england or south africa or argentina or botswana and my point would still be fine. that wasn't the point i was making. i was trying to illustrate that because of proximity, the us would make far more than any of our allies. that's not to say we wouldn't make international requests. 

i just think we'd make fewer requests if the servers were domestic.  it was as uncreative a film as you could possibly imagine.if it's pointless, why do you care?have been to valve hq, this is not the case. one of the cabals on the 5th floor is the steam support cabal. they specifically mentioned that all steam support employees must be fluent in a minimum of two languages. that's 100% bullshit. the bottom floor of valve's office is steam support staff. there's somewhere between 15 and 30 people there. 

source: i've been in that cabal. things to also consider:

* *many* data servers with information the us will want is already in the us, thus under their jurisdiction. i'd bet top dollar that germany, for example, would have a lot more requests if a huge chunk of the internet was hosted within their borders. 
* a lot of this information is self-reported by the companies hosting the information. you wont see china reporting the amount of data pulled from the chinese national social media site, will you?
* other nations friendly with the us can simply ask the us to make requests on their behalf. since a lot of this information is reported by the company and not the government, this fact would go entirely unnoticed.

if hicks is alive, alien 3 can't happen. the start of alien 3 is literally the death of newt and hicks immediately following their ejection from the sulaco after aliens. 

&gt; how can they logically explain her huge aging from aliens

malfunctioning cryo tubes. it kept them alive but didn't keep them from aging. also explains why hick's face is no longer a bloody mess.

&gt; younger again int the fourth movie?

the same way they explain how ripley is alive in alien resurrection? she died in alien 3. this film is supposed to retcon alien 3. if blomkamp's film exists, alien 3 ceases to be canon. at least he had the dignity to put it in writing, and to at least pay lip service to the idea of a conflict with a known time limit.

well at least half of it has to do with the fact that the model here isn't michael biehn, but someone else. 

this is mostly just a sort of meatspace proof of concept. fuck. 

edit: he get's promoted. that's it. http://www.slashfilm.com/neill-blomkamp-alien-movie/says someone who i can guarantee hasn't been in a classroom since they themselves were in school. via the [replica prop forum's facebook](https://www.facebook.com/therpf?fref=nf)the first image is the cover artwork from tarkus, by progressive rock group [emerson, lake, and palmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5thusiczd6m). 

storytelling in games is a quantum leap from storytelling in cinema. 

&gt; would much prefer to see a film that is based around a queen - she has been largely sidelined from the films and seems unexplored given the ambiguity built from the final scenes of aliens.

what exactly needs to be explored? she's a giant bug, an ant or bee queen, end of story. there's nothing to explore beyond what was covered in aliens.&gt; it being the 3rd most played doesn't mean it's doing great, it's a free to play game. think of how many accounts online are bots, idles, hackers, etc.

&gt; and those legit players are mostly contained inside quickplay servers, believe me i've done a rough estimate of the numbers before. around 60% of traffic is inside of quickplay, while at least 5% are in idle servers, the rest i can't deal with.

and without any hard numbers, this is all speculation and hyperbolic bullshit. the only people who actually have this information is valve, and valve has demonstrated themselves to be capable and adept at responding to what *data* shows. 

if valve hasn't responded to what you perceive to be a problem, i'm more inclined to believe that you have an inflated view of how prevalent the problem is, rather than valve not caring enough to do something. 

&gt; it's not so much about people's responsibility to protect their account, it's the culture that has come with trading and the fact that the problem got as large as it has. now with the recent steamworks change, any game can have tradable economy items in it. this i'm aware isn't too much of valve's fault, but valve hasn't exactly cracked down on the economy either, and they've been putting in items with artificial rarity in over the years. (knifes, unusuals, unusual taunts, etc)

i fail to see a problem with this. you're upset that economies act like economies? 

valve's economies aren't pay-to-win, they're pay-to-pretty. if your problem is what other developers have done, then you're barking up the wrong tree.

&gt; tf2 is notorious lately for the amount of bugs coming in with each update, leading people to ask what all happened to the beta anyway?

how many people play the beta servers? if there's no-one there still testing, how would valve actually test this stuff?

let me also take this moment to comment that at this point in time, the number of different variables in the tf2 equation is astronomical. you need to be able to balance and refine every single weapon, *and* balance it against every other single weapon. 

this has been a problem going back to the pyro update when the backburner was added. valve acknowledged that one of the massive problems with adding new content is that it's very easy to break your balance the more items you have. 

it's a known issue that frankly has no solution.

&gt; valve is known for keeping themselves tight-lipped, but that isn't a good a thing, it shouldn't be something we just accept because okay they're valve it's all good.

sure, i get that, but you needed to have started complaining about this 15 years ago. it's like a 13 year old learning that the us isn't the wonderful country they thought it was. it's not an original thought, and everyone else stopped caring.

&gt; wicked wouldn't say, but the dota 2 item api isn't public for anyone, other than one specific community that has it.

you mean [this api](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/dota_2_workshop_tools/scripting/api)? 

&gt; in tf2, there are a number of communities that break valve's "law" against attachable items, attachables was a system that'd let you attach things to player models, it was removed out of tf2 entirely once people started using it to sell valve hats to players. some communities (like saxton hell and a few other large ones) have worked around that limitation and have sold user mods as wearable objects. when brought up to valve, they've had nothing to say on the subject.

and to be totally honest, i don't give a shit about these communities. i don't play their servers, so i don't see the problem. 

and if i was valve, i wouldn't give a flying fuck, either, much the same way blizzard never really cared about the private wow servers that people ran out of their own pocket. valve's job when enforcing multiplayer is to enforce *only what they host*. 

otherwise, you need to start building some complex rules: what is the criteria for banning a server/community from an entire gaming ecosystem? do servers with grapplinghooks/prop hunt/other "non-invasive" modifications get an exception? is that even fair?

&gt; just recently they did post a statement, saying people need to stop match betting / fixing in cs:go, they do have the capability to see what is going on and talk about it, so it's not like things are totally dead.

ok, so then they *are* being transparent, and they *are* addressing the problem. what's the deal?i don't know. blomkamp's take on what alien 3 should be is pretty much what resurrection was trying to do but ultimately failed at. 

alien 3 felt more to me like the scoobie doo ghost than what you're describing, because it was basically another "oh no, we're a bunch of people being slowly picked off by a (some) xenomorphs in a vaguely sci-fi world!" the mystery behind what was killing people was essentially gone, you knew exactly what it was.

blomkamp is good at the "a few people trying to take down a monolithic foe" story, and that's exactly what alien resurrection needed to have but didn't. with two established and solid characters (ripley and hicks), we may actually have a fighting chance at something that could stand on its own two feet, unlike alien 3 and resurrection which both required alien and aliens. 

and that's what i think this would need. we don't need another film with the alien as the protagonist. we *know* the alien, the expose is done. what we need is a story set in that universe with a new and dangerous foe, and i think weyland-yutani is the go-to for that. &gt; quickplay killing tf2

the game is 8 years old and is *still* the third most played game on steam. you're fighting an uphill battle by claiming anything is killing tf2 that isn't old age.

&gt; the problem with hackers

been playing both tf2 and cs:go for years (though have eased off in the past year) and i haven't noticed any problems. 

&gt; the problem with account thefts

between two-step authentication and warnings on urls in steam chat, i fail to see how this is valve's problem. if you're too stupid to secure your own account, that's on you.

&gt; the problem with buggy untested updates and poor quality control

in what, exactly? games, steam, what?

&gt; the lack of communication with the community

this is *valve* we're talking about, the kings of keeping tight lipped. 

&gt; some communities getting things they're not supposed to have

could you be more vague?

&gt; all of the recent cash grabs

your first actual concern that i agree with.

&gt; the focus on competitive play while having a very toxic competitive community 

that's not valve's problem. toxicity of the community is often outside of the developers control. bioware is another company known for having toxic communities, and the reality is that it's wicked hard to keep a community from being so.

community moderators are responsible for keeping things running nicely, not the developer. such as?why are you surprised?big data is awesome when it gives me more kevin spacey.i'd watch it.i sort of got that vibe when i first started flying them, but i just seem to perform better with the p-38 and p-47. i must just like it slow and sturdy. you guys are in /r/militaryporn and are complaining about wasted tax dollars?fuck militarization, because it causes people to attack cops!

sounds like a pretty sound justification for militarization. and it's taken down. depends on the p-, imo. some of the p-63's are... well pretty shitty. even with the best cannons installed, the shells are just way too inconsistent and slow to do me any good.

the p-38's cannon is where it's at. smaller caliber but a much tighter spread. &gt; (because most us pilots are bad)

i feel like this is 30% of why i'm so good with the p-38. people see me and don't take me seriously because i'm an american pilot.

then they lose a wing and i go on my merry way as an eater of other planes. it's a pretty cool build, i agree. i've built almost exclusively wwii equipment (stug-iii, panzer v, t-34, bf.109, me-262) and modern american equipment (m1, m2, m1135, ah-64), but this gun is probably the most interesting one i've built.

it *almost* feels more like a toy than most of the other models i've built, simply because it has so many moving parts. &gt; still don't wanna be the one shooting that thing, i don't fancy death by radiation poisoning :3

no kidding. but the military was chock full of crazy stuff like that at the beginning, and it's wonderful! nuclear landmines, nuclear-propelled rockets and aircraft, atomic artillery and man portable launchers, neutron bombs, pretty much the atom stuffed into every weapon of war we knew and some we didn't.

&gt; forgive me for thinking that the 15-minute set up and disassembly time is the military being deluded.

oh i don't believe it either. i think *maybe* you could pull 15 if you didn't strap the gun carriage down to the carrying arms on the trucks, but i'm not sure how well that would work in a mad dash away from the firing site.

though i really think this was supposed to be something you put in a fortified position. apparently they were deployed in both korea and europe, so i figure they must have been positioned well behind the front lines and protected by quite a bit of other equipment. thanks! i'll hold out till wip wednesday, but in the meantime, [i do have a small album of the assembled and unpainted kit](http://imgur.com/a/tyqmg). amazingly, it appears that revell has been reproducing these kits. near as i can tell, my kit was manufactured sometime in 2012. jury's still out on whether it used the original molds, though. 

&gt; how was the atomic cannon?

lotta large pieces, not many small finicky ones. i'm not really sure if detail was lost in the model compared to the original, but the large pieces appear to be quite well detailed. the cabs of the trucks are pretty spartan, though.

&gt; you should post pictures of it as you go

certainly! [here's a current wip album (i'll post an album in the main subreddit once i get some paint on it).](http://imgur.com/a/tyqmg)heh, the [davy crockett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/davy_crockett_%28nuclear_device%29) i'm guessing? they've got an example of it at the nuclear testing museum in las vegas, and it's a pretty comical device.

apparently they jeep-mounted the thing so the crew could fire and immediately run like hell to avoid getting hit in the blast. the launcher was also supposed to be man-portable, but i'd sure hate to be assigned to one of those teams. 

but the m-65 was basically the us army grabbing german railway guns and putting them on the backs of purpose built trucks. there's a great bit of footage from one of the tests in nevada called [upshot-knothole grable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9f-l_3elce).

allegedly, the crew could set the gun up in 15 minutes, fire, and tear it down in another 15 minutes. with a range of 20 miles, they had at least a fighting chance of not getting killed by the explosion, *and* had the chance to get the hell out of the area to avoid retaliation. 

the army went on to develop a pair of nuclear artillery shells for 155mm and 203mm which could be equipped in more conventional artillery pieces. the m-65 would be the only purpose-built field artillery piece for atomic artillery. 

i've always wanted one of these models because pretty much everything we built at the beginning of the cold war was just magnificently crazy. hello! 22 year old cs undergrad, here! 

i've been building models, props, and costumes for about 10 years now, starting with tamiya tank builds when i was young and spiraling out to replica props and later costumes as i got older.

my most recent project is the [renwal m-65 atomic cannon](http://www.amazon.com/atomic-cannon-anniversary-renwal-revell/dp/b00bjmi4om) which was actually a really fun build. revell did a great job with the moving parts (the gun actually elevates via a gearbox!), so that's been pretty cool. looking forward to painting it and coming up with a nice diorama-type base for it. where exactly did you visit?can i just point out that vol.178.13 of the us time is the same thing as the rest of the world's vol.178.19? yet the article still paints the us as publishing "fluffy pop-psychology stories"?because of the quality of both half-life and half-life 2, people expect just as much if not more polish. then add on the fact that both half-life and half-life 2 incorporated gameplay concepts that had barely been touched, leading them to be universally new experiences.

half-life 3, in order to live up to expectation, must be polished to the point that no-one could find a fault in the game, and must break ground in a new and important way. no gimmicks, no glitches, no sub-par assembly.

that's a *very* tough bill to match. &gt; real science happens outside of high school..

yeah, but guess where you're supposed to learn rudimentary scientific literacy? 

&gt; read this

ok. did you?

the article talks about:

a) the reality that 1/3 of the american public doesn't trust trained meteorological and climatology scientists

b) that in the past few years we've seen a slowdown in the rate at which the overall climate has warmed

c) that el nino, a weather system that is affected by climate change in the first place, might affect the climate in the coming years in a way that scientists have yet to fully understand.

&gt; this is an example of 1 climate cycle we don't understand..

we don't *fully* understand. remember what i mentioned about rudimentary scientific literacy? *this is one of those times where what you covered in high school is super important*. 

[here is what *just the noaa* has figured out about el nino](http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/proj_over/pubs/taopubsr.shtml). obviously we understand parts of it, nobody with a modicum of scientific literacy would believe that we don't know anything about it. 

&gt; the thing is there are many of them..

yes, and that is why we conduct *research*. but you don't need to know everything to be able to make reasonably informed predictions, just like you don't need a 4k camera to recognize that a picture of matt damon is a picture of matt damon. you haven't taken a science class since high school, i'm guessing?honestly i'm a tad surprised clippard doesn't just resell the items that fail to meet quality requirements to the prop community. 

they can't sell defective products anyways, and none of us prop-builders honestly give a shit if the thing does what it's supposed to do as long as it looks good. "limited time"?shoot, i was close. 1) mb/s is not the same as mb/s. most network speeds are listed in mb/s, while hard drives and other storage media will be listed in mb. (eg. 1mb/s = 8mb/s)

2) part of the overall download speed is also dependent on the speed of the source server. steam's servers might just be slower.and by work, you mean microsoft's redmond campus, i presume?

i'm like 80% positive that those are microsoft's (spectacular) dining courts in the background. &gt; non-vaccinated people are really only dangerous to the non-vaccinated.

no. this is a myth. non-vaccinated individuals are risks to *both* vaccinated and un-vaccinated individuals.

*vaccines are not 100% guarantees*. this shit has been covered time and again by the cdc, and people are *still* fucking bringing the thing up!

emphasis mine:

&gt; misconception #2. the majority of people who get disease have been vaccinated.
this is another argument frequently found in anti-vaccine literature - the implication being that this proves vaccines are not effective. in fact it is true that in an outbreak those who have been vaccinated often outnumber those who have not - even with vaccines such as measles, which we know to be about 98% effective when used as recommended.
&gt;    
&gt; this is explained by two factors. no vaccine is 100% effective. most routine childhood vaccines are effective for 85% to 95% of recipients. for reasons related to the individual, some will not develop immunity. the second fact is that in a country such as the united states the people who have been vaccinated vastly outnumber those who have not. here's a hypothetical example of how these two factors work together.
&gt;    
&gt; *in a high school of 1,000 students, none has ever had measles. all but 5 of the students have had two doses of measles vaccine, and so are fully immunized. the entire student body is exposed to measles, and every susceptible student becomes infected. the 5 unvaccinated students will be infected, of course. but of the 995 who have been vaccinated, we would expect several not to respond to the vaccine. the efficacy rate for two doses of measles vaccine can be higher than 99%. in this class, 7 students do not respond, and they, too, become infected.* **therefore 7 of 12, or about 58%, of the cases occur in students who have been fully vaccinated.**
&gt;    
&gt; as you can see, this doesn't prove the vaccine didn't work - only that most of the children in the class had been vaccinated, so those who were vaccinated and did not respond outnumbered those who had not been vaccinated. looking at it another way, 100% of the children who had not been vaccinated got measles, compared with less than 1% of those who had been vaccinated. measles vaccine protected most of the class; if nobody in the class had been vaccinated, there would probably have been 1,000 cases of measles.

[source](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/6mishome.htm)

edit: on [herd immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herd_immunity):

different diseases have different thresholds of required immunization to keep a population safe. for example, to keep a population safe from the measles, between 83%-94% of the population *must be vaccinated*. if the number of un-immunized individuals exceed 17%, the safety of the entire population is in jeopardy, and the odds of immunizations failing **increases**. 

for the sake of an *entire population*, a certain percent of people must be immunized. additionally, there must be enough space in the un-immunized population for individuals who cannot be immunized due to legitimate health concerns (allergies, compromised immune systems, etc). if 15% of the population requires immunization, 12% of the population cannot be immunized due to legitimate health concerns, and 8% of the population refuses immunization based on bullshit reasons, the safety of *everybody* is compromised, especially those who are at a medical disadvantage. 

every individual who is medically fit *must be immunized*. this isn't a debate, it's a fucking reality. &gt; the reactor ran fine until they changed its purpose.

ignoring that they had to routinely anneal the reactor to prevent the graphite from disintegrating, sure.

&gt; the altered fuel mixture and cartridges meant that the thermocouples were no longer in the correct spot so the uneven heating from the fire wasn't noticed for over 48 hours.

which is a problem with sensing equipment. no contemporary reactor would be allowed to function with dead zones in sensor ranges. 

&gt; without the change in purpose, the fire may still have happened but the disaster would have been avoided.

doubtful. the reactor had no safety systems similar to those found in contemporary facilities. no control rods, and no method of extinguishing a fire short of cutting off the air (the same way they killed this fire).simpson is a safety officer (basically an osha lackey), not an engineer. that's what happens when reactor design is still in its infancy and we have no prior experience with anomalies and accidents. 

ftfy. from three years ago. except in matters of public safety where herd immunity is one of the major benefits of vaccinations, your right to be an idiot does not supersede everyone else's right to be healthy.

believing it's your right to not vaccinate is the same as believing it's your right to drive drunk. [rand paul believes vaccines should be optional.](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/rand-paul-vaccines-114845.html)

[so does chris christie](http://www.wnd.com/2015/02/chris-christie-fires-major-shot-in-vaccine-war/). first rule of being a master at something: if you think you're a master, you're not. yes but in space we're taking radiation more seriously, anyway. on the ground, you're not concerned about solar radiation.

in space, everything has to be shielded from it. &gt; why does everyone find this strange?

when the information is literally keystrokes away, most people find it very hard to be sympathetic towards college grads who don't know how simple things like personal finance work. it's not like there's countless resources on the internet to figure it out or anything. you graduated from college and still can't add, subtract, or figure out interest?what is peyton manning known for?

throwing fucking awesome passes. 

good guy general: "we can't drive tanks on our shitty highways because the crumbling asphalt and concrete can't take the weight."

gov accountant: "could the highways do it before?"

good guy general: "no, but think of the transportation savings if they could."...stealth chinook?call the police, bro. i literally didn't notice that transition. i'm struggling to see how it would mean better graphics.

a competent developer can make an antiquated engine look stellar. case in point, [titanfall's use of source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/titanfall). any developer that solely believes that new engine == better graphics is a poor developer from an engineering perspective.

heck, look at the difference in quality between valve's most recent source games (cs:go, dota2, portal 2) and the original source games (half-life 2, cs:s, dod). the difference in quality is astounding. 

other things a new engine could focus on rather than graphics:

* improved multiplayer/netcode performance (cs:go, dota2)
* improved artificial intelligence and agent logic (left 4 dead, dota2)
* improved content production process (steam workshop, portal 2 map editor)

my dream job is *also* working at valve. rolling the ball on the ground would've been more effective.not the coach, the offensive coordinator. 

source: go look at /r/seahawks right now.wilson is also saying it's his fault, too, for not overriding such a stupid play. 

so yeah, there's that. i think both guys are trying to take the responsibility for bevell's colossal fuckup. i'm like 90% certain that that's pete falling on the sword for bevell. to be fair, if all you've seen of him in the past hour is his twitter feed, you'd have a pretty warped perception. 

edit: actually that's not even his twitter. fuck, it's just a bunch of imitators. 

god i hate reddit's inability to do research when the hate is flowing. maybe the guy just isn't social. ahhh... popcorn buttered but by our rivals (i'm purdue) is the tastiest popcorn.in /r/seattle?

he's probably legit.not in indianapolis, but true grit ink in franklin does piercings without the gun. you know most people here don't either, right?wolfenstein: the new order and l.a. noire would be my two picks. it's a warm 20 degrees here in north-central indiana. almost feels balmy. heath ledger's joker was *phenomenal* for nolan's version of the batman universe. remember: people assumed heath ledger was a terrible choice for the joker, too.

i'm refraining from passing judgement until i actually see the film. &gt; but.....sun king is terrible....

your opinion is wrong. i refuse to believe we live in the western world until we're allowed to buy booze on sundays. it's pretty simple:

duty believes that the zone is dangerous, and see it as their mission to prevent access to the zone to protect the public.

freedom believes the zone should remain unprotected, and that people should be free to enter as they please. no, not republican constituents. mostly just republican politicians. say what you want about id's ability to develop games, they really know how to make them gorgeous. almost every company i've interviewed with has said something to the same effect. 

the reality is that it's next to impossible for a college education to teach the spectrum of skills necessary for every possible job in the market. what microsoft wants isn't the same as what oracle wants isn't the same as what ea wants. there's just way too many skills to teach with a single education. instead, college is supposed to give you the core essentials, the tools you will use almost anywhere you go. 

everything beyond that is going to be taught to you by the company you work for. their only expectations is that you have the skills college taught you, and that you're a fast learn. &gt; are you republican?

i don't subscribe to either. i tend towards democrats, but there's quite a few republican politicians i've taken a liking to.

&gt; i always find it funny when democrats pretend to know what republicans want or what's in their hearts or best interests better than republicans do.

so republican constituents *do* want to fuck the poor with sales tax? what the hell are you trying to say, here?


the 40% of the nation who votes republican don't share that interest. 

the 40% who vote republican do so for other reasons, and then republicans do this shit anyways because nobody holds them accountable for their actions. that's a fucking boss tattoo, dude. add taxes, then add equivalent value of social services received. just because we don't understand the public's fear doesn't mean they're right.i don't really think anyone with working knowledge of nuclear energy thinks it's the whole solution.better than the movie version.uh... 

microsoft it hires cs people? and if the bitcoin exchange goes tits up? what use is a bunch of keys if you can't even use them? 

also, i can pull all of my money out of the bank in the form of "dollars". i wonder what they think bitcoin is.i don't think creative assembly was expecting a huge number of sales. their marketing was pretty minimal, all things considered. this is probably the tamest thing i've seen posted here, to be honest. everything said had at least some truth to it (eg giggling is a bad idea). as true as that may be, poland has a list of reasons a mile long as to why they should not be friendly with russia, which dates back to before even the second world war. the obvious reasons are the invasion of poland by both nazi germany and the ussr, the katyn, volhynia, and galicia massacres, the exile of countless polish citizens by the soviets, and being put under the yoke by the ussr.

even during the cold war, the ussr had to make piles of exceptions for poland in order to maintain some semblance of control, even making allowances for members of the [polish government-in-exile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_government-in-exile) to hold positions in the communist polish government. 

you also have to remember that there's a huge number of polish immigrants in the west who were displaced by german/russian activity during both the second world war and the cold war. the [polish diaspora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_diaspora) is one of the largest in the world, totaling some 20,000,000 poles living outside of poland. heck, chicago is the largest polish city in the world behind warsaw.  

racial/cultural heritage means nothing if those who you are similar to treat you like shit. who keeps pictures of themselves as babies in their lockers?officially, no.

as per the letter from [l.m.](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/half-life/images/7/7a/gordon_letter_ps2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091020162206&amp;path-prefix=en), gordon has no wife or children. i believe the picture in his locker is a niece/nephew. simple workaround: updating meaningless files would remove the banner. to combat that, valve'd need to invest in examining every update in person to ensure updates provide meaningful content. 

not feasible. though other suggestion of including a "last updated" somewhere prominent is a good idea. definitely japanese.assuming the power increases at a linear rate, sure.define "rolling in money".no.

they weren't working under turing. they'd actually managed to make a lot of head-way without him, but it was turing and his team who managed to figure out the rotor problem. 

turing didn't break the code, he broke a part of it. 

source: i'm a computer scientist with polish heritage. oh, gee, mister, i think you're right! 

boy, it's a good thing people don't mind having others act condescending about their hobbies! doesn't matter: they're only trying to have fun. if playing the same rehashed games over and over is enough for them, i'm not going to judge.

it's only when someone gets shitty about something that *i* do that i've got a problem. no, it's not what i think. fuck.i play the original quake all the time, doesn't mean i'm not having fun despite the antiquated graphics.*ok*. 

i'll be totally honest, i'm a pcmr subscriber, and *this* pisses me off. 

the whole pcmr joke was fueled by the perpetually dick measuring of the console people. the perpetual "my 1080p is better than your 1080p but at least we're not nerds like the pc players" was what gave us the desire to create our own elitist community as a kind of psuedo-satirical foil.

nintendo people, though, were different. they weren't impressed by tech, they just wanted to have fun. and many pcmr people recognized this, and understood that *that* was what gaming is supposed to be about. it's about *fun*, not the tech or dick measuring. 

so we accepted the nintendo folk because we recognized that they were doing exactly what everyone as games are supposed to be doing. they were the pure of heart who just wanted to smile and have some fun.

so to see a new pcmr mod say that we shouldn't respect them is flat out insulting to the cause. we're supposed to be having fun, goddammit. space jockey.yeah that's not what you led with. you're back peddling really hard here.in short: nowhere convenient.

the long answer is to track down a costume maker and pay them to do it, but it'll be a serious chunk of change. titanfall doesn't have the staying power of, say, star wars or halo, so anyone who has created titanfall gear hasn't made the process easily repeatable. 

almost any gear you can find will have been custom made. you say that with such confidence. the way the chernobyl disaster was handled in the ukraine is all kinds of terrible.

plus, afaik, there weren't any nuclear processing facilities in the eastern bloc. the russian's kept all of them hidden deep in the urals and siberia so as to better protect them from surveillance and keep them far from the west. no no, i know. i just liked that little joke. uh... one will criticize the united states and president obama at the drop of a hat, and the other is the mouthpiece of the russian government? i would sooner trust a group of corporations than i would the russian government. 

that said, i trust neither. i *expect* people to be evil. i can rationalize it.

that is why i find "institutional" evil trivial emotionally.piracy is what drove many developers away from our platform.http://m.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201109/the-rare-truth-about-tight-and-loose-womenthat's a myth.the us government isn't giving msm $300million+ in funding.more than you can trust rt.where was this found?

look great, though! this may just be because of a crappy picture, but is brains of indian descent, now?but then valve doesn't need a staff of 400.you're basing this on the fact that valve hasn't released a new game in a while, i presume?

microsoft: publicly traded company valued at $343 billion.

valve: privately held company valued at $3 billion.

microsoft has the resources to make such a leap, valve does not. no. valve is a software company. going to hardware when you're geared for software is very difficult.ahh... that's a huge bummer.

but thanks for answering my question!i figured as much. 

follow up question: if i were either very close to a given nebula (within, say, a light year), or inside of one, would i be able to see the clouds? or would i still see only black?i've got a copy. was probably my first music purchase ever.exactly. same era, different roles, very different construction and outfitting. this is the best in-universe explanation, imo.

the nostromo is a freighter; big, industrial, simple to maintain. same principals go for the sulaco and hadley's hope. 

the prometheus is meant to be a state of the art vessel, the first of it's kind designed to reach places humans have yet to even dream of going. money was poured into the ship, and the tech reflects that. it's not an opinion. your model is *wrong*. 
that's like you saying 2+2=5, someone correcting you, and you just saying "well, that's your opinion."

you're *wrong*. hell yeah i do.

though in my defense, i did answer the question.raising the bar had a section for half-life, tf, cs, and dod. but it only takes up about a quarter of the whole book.

good luck finding a cheap copy, though. the book went out of print years ago and is quite a collectors item. 

mine has been signed by gabe newell and a number of the original developers, but they were close to $100 used before i got it signed in 2011.i'm part of said group and disagree. we routinely post pictures of people being assholes and condemn them as such. 

the vast majority are people who are there for the joke. no. there's just more of us than you think. or that's just how yahtzee draws his videos.and i've known console owners with the exact same attitude. don't pretend it's exclusive to us.when you turn your hobby into your job, you no longer have a hobby. it's not like it'd change much. you have to be as inattentive as a grunt to get killed by the smart pistol.department of science for us. though we are the oldest school to have the computer science program as an actual science.it absolutely is, i agree.and it's not like you read the edit i made, either.if you're just looking at the numbers, sure. i wrote the comment before i read about how sampling was performed. oh it's absolutely not an adequate representation. statistical confidence only works assuming you have a good sampling of your total population. 

but i've seen a *lot* of people say that 250 isn't enough of a sample for 235,000, and that's just not true. 25% of 118 is 29.5. 118 plus 29.5 is 147.5.for a 95% confidence level with a margin of error of about 6%, you would need a sample size of 266 for a population of 235,000.

do you even statistics?

edit: ignoring, of course, the idiocy that is sampling for a single city. for a 95% confidence level (plus or minus 6%), you'd need a sample size of 266 for a population of 235,000.

this survey seems totally reasonable to me. and then it ultimately doesn't matter, because only the students from rich families can afford to go to us schools. yes, and the 18 million from what would be north vietnam would basically just fuck over the 12 million from what would be the south. 

30 million people disagreed on what to do and it started a war. the soviets backed one side, and we backed the other. if people really wanted to democratically choose, the two should have split and never brought it up again. but the reality is that the north was aggressing the south, and after we left they took total control. so those 12 million don't have the right to not want a communist government because they fixed a vote?not really a lot. we're talking, like, 25% more. apollo was $118bn in 2014 dollars, iss is $150bn.same as /u/mp3nut, all i get is a picture.heck, according to wikipedia:

&gt; another potential issue that has been reported is the effect of mirror glare on airplane pilots.[53]&gt; shouts "+1 mana!" after drinking a mtn dew code red

welp, now i'm irrationally angry. quote from pacific rim, and a titan exo-skeleton from titanfall.

aight. international recognition and about 12 million vietnamese. &gt; which did not represent the people of vietnam at all. 

it recognized about half of them. and the other half identified with the communist government.

hence the god-damn war. the americans and french supported the republic of vietnam, and the soviets and chinese supported the democratic republic of vietnam, two nations who were warring for control over the other. 

edit: i made a stupid.usually, yes. guaranteed, no. but it wouldn't hurt to sit tight and wait, though. at the request of the recognized legitimate government, yes. &gt; us went in precisely because the propped up regime in south vietnam had insufficient domestic support.

not our fucking fault. blame france for propping up a pro-capitalist regime and then bailing on actually supporting them. high five!

half-life was what made me want to pursue a hard science education. 3rd grade me wanted to be a theoretical physicist.

later in life, learning about how the game and subsequent sequel were made got me interested in computer science and eventually game programming. i even visited valve and talked to a developer about what i should study and learn.

now i'm wrapping up my cs degree with a concentration in machine intelligence and a minor in theatrical design.

thanks, half-life!writing lore in booklets was a necessity because to put it in the game would consume a huge amount of otherwise precious memory. we're talking about a time when a full color, 50+ page booklet cost less than a few mb of hard drive or disk space.

nowadays, with multi-terabyte hard drives, the lore is just part of the game. 

also, booklets for the most part predated the internet. what once required you to read the manual is done with an equally quick google search. technical guy here (work it, study cs), i only hear hard g. 

everyone who says otherwise is pronounced an idiot. there is, it's .gifa bunch of stuff gabe allegedly said, but not even a direct quote?

are you for fucking real? it definitely is, but that's pretty much the only thing i can think of that a non-cs major could get into. if i'm not mistaken, cs 251 requires cs 240 (and 180/182), and that's pretty much the first *real* cs course. 

that said, cs 182 is really good at teaching you that cs is basically just math. read the article.read the article.so no, you don't. do you have tattoos?you could have right clicked the game executable and told it to run in compatibility mode.that's not too much, but you won't be able to do it all at purdue as far as i am aware.

my suggestion: take one of the classes mentioned by others, which will knock out the programming side of things. 

for the cs theory, look into whether you can take cs 182, which may be restricted. alternatively, look into coursera classes, there should be some decent ones around.do you want to learn *programming*, or *computer science*?

because the two are very different fields. it's like met vs me.no no no. he *never* learnt what to do with emotions besides bottling them up. he never learnt to deal with the emotional trauma involved with losing people and things he cares about. 

the deaths of countless soldiers, civilians, spartans, and cortana are all traumas that *will* catch up with him. all he learned to do was ignore those losses and keep fighting.

the war is over. there is no more fighting. he isn't needed like he used to be, so now all he has left is thirty years of bottled emotional trauma. he can't ignore it and keep fighting because there is no more fight.and the chief doesn't have that base. at no point in his life as a spartan has he had the time to develop the way a normal human is meant to. so you're saying the chief has had no adverse mental effects from his nearly thirty years of brutal warfare? nor do you see the paragraph mark in published books.but 30+ years of front line combat mixed with the fact that each spartan had no childhood and were subject to what is essentially brainwashing? plex?how the fuck would any spartan not have ptsd after everything they've gone through.it appears to work, though i do have an "ns" for one of my classes. 

not really sure if that's a system bug (eg, everything hasn't been totally processed), or my professor is lazy. first, don't feel guilty. you're at purdue for *you*, not the university. if you need the leave, take it and don't worry about what purdue will think. 

second, speak with your advisor. they'll know the answer to this question.&gt; oh yeah forgot purdue is full of uptight jesus lovers.

fucking lol. jesus christ, "intimidation aspect"?

if the police are rolling out to get you with a fucking mrap, *you're already in the deepest shit*. 

&gt; there is no need to militarize our police force when we have the us marines, army, navy, air force and coast guard always at the ready.

ever hear of the posse comitatus act? [it was codified into federal law that the military *cannot* be used to police civilians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/posse_comitatus_act). the us army cannot be used to enforce laws. the usaf cannot be used to enforce laws. the usn cannot be used to enforce laws. 

&gt; these are to be used against its citizens. 

the police should be allowed to have any equipment that civilians themselves can buy/own/create. if i can own an automatic rifle, so can the police. [if i can own an mrap or other armored car, so can the police. ](http://www.armyjeeps.net/armor1.htm)

the police are meant to be able to address *any* possible scenario. mraps are reserved for *those* scenarios, not routine traffic stops. i appreciate the statisticians more, they're the ones who gave us these tools.where the fuck am i?pretty much every comment i've written in here, taken out of context, could get me fired. a solid 6. 

if i lost 30lbs, shaved, got a haircut, wore something other than a t-shirt and jeans, and spent 2+ weeks on an extensive psoriasis treatment regimen, i'd be an 8.

my fiance, though, thinks i'm closer to a 9. i think she's lying. same here. i've maintained a 96% in both 300 level history courses i've taken with minimal stress.

i don't know if that means i'm really good at those classes, or they were easy. it really bothers me that there isn't a "vanilla" version of the characters that have updated textures/models, and that so much of the rich setting is lost in the pursuit of dicks.

i was under the impression that alyx's "bedroom" in bm:e had a dildo no matter what you did. spoiler: alyx vance gets slutted up. i don't know why, but this was one of the few things that almost made me die from laughing so hard. 

i really, *really* don't understand why.no that's wireless networking. no no no. don't pin this on us. it's not our fault that nobody actually read *computing machinery and intelligence.* literally one of the first things that was said on the concept of ai was that it's impossible to define, so we're just going to try to do something different. all of the terms we use other than "intelligence" have basis in reality.

god-damn, the turing test is like schrodinger's cat of computer science. maybe because they're not built to?see how not-fun it is when other's immediately start shoving words in your mouth?

let's just agree that nobody knows anything about what happened, who did it, or why the fuck they're doing it. everything we're doing here is just a waste of our time. to be fair, god intervening in that situation is like micro-managing a single unit in an rts.

it's fucking *boring*. nothing happens *anywhere* without reason. it's not limited to geopolitics.

do you honestly believe someone broke into sony's system and started making death threats "just for the lulz"?why the fuck does north korea do *anything*, dude?

&gt;  if nk truly had the ability to utilize expert hackers, then why aren't they using these hackers to perform constant surveillance on the financial system and big corporations

who says they do? all i said is that it's possible north korea payed chinese hackers. i didn't say they were good hackers, and i didn't say north korea has been doing this for years.

all i suggested was *maybe* north korea hired some chinese hackers. don't stick words in my mouth.

&gt; why was there no outrage over team america world police?

[there](http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/05/breaking2453411.0520833335.html) [was](http://www.thestar.com.my/story/?file=%2f2005%2f2%2f5%2flatest%2f21181northkore&amp;sec=latest). i just know how to use google.hell, that's how i feel about both the public and even some of you guys when it comes to anything ai/ml related.

what ai/ml *isn't*: i-robot type hyper intelligent "beings" who arbitrarily decide to kill all humans because we're "part of the problem".

what ai/ml *is*: a lot of linear algebra and some statistics. oh, and a lot of hard-coded responses and very few dynamically generated ones. he may be close, though. 

it could be chinese hackers being payed by north korea. it often takes up to two weeks. just wait it out. 

whatever you do, do not send a follow up. it will put you at the back of the queue. i'm no fan, either. though i guess i am insulated up here in west lafayette.ok, *this isn't wwii*. winter is a warfare concern *if* you are unable to keep your troops adequately supplied. 

napolean didn't have planes or vehicular convoys. hitler did, but not enough, even if his weak economy *could* produce the necessary supplies.

the us, though, has easily the most impressive military infrastructure *in history*. ever hear of the [berlin airlift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_blockade#the_start_of_the_berlin_airlift)? the us kept the *entire* city of berlin fed and clothed using nothing but our airlift infrastructure for *over 11 months*. and that was using nothing but c-54 skymasters.

imagine what we could do now using c-130's, c-5's, and c-17's. if hitler had access to the us' economy and supply infrastructure, russia would've been reduced to rubble. did you *read* that comparison?

outside of tanks, oil production, and debt, the us outpaces russia fairly handily. written by none other than [michael snyder,](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/michael_t._snyder) and posted to [zero hedge](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/zero_hedge).

forgive me if i ask for more credible sources. i'm excited, but it kills me that the first season hasn't even aired yet.maybe because any war they win results in huge numbers of their own casualties?

and again, vietnam was an insurgency. and china had a large amount of soviet support.&gt; the iraqi army didn't want to fight they had no motive to defend a dictator they all hated.

and you think the russian military is going to want to fight at the behest of putin? the guy who has probably gotten them into that whole mess? 

yeah, the russians have a really high amount of nationalism, but *so did the us at the beginning of the iraq war*. 

&gt; bombers and missiles only soften and disrupt the enemy they cant hold ground and take important locations let alone a capital city.

we built an entire military doctrine around the concept of dumping ordinance on targets. hell, even our armor doctrine relies heavily on air support. the us military *thrives* under air support. there's a reason why we operate the two largest air forces in world, and it's because we're really goddamn good at it.

yes, ground troops will need to be involved. but there's no reason why we can't just bombard our targets for four months and then roll in with armor, mechanized, and cas come spring. 

&gt; how is this 'absurdly large supply of cruise missiles' dealing with isis?

*actually* pretty good, assuming we have something to shoot. the problem is that it's really tricky to get decent intel on insurgent movements without boots on the ground. and that's kinda the whole point of an insurgency: you operate small enough so that you can stay under the radar. and guerilla warfare has existed for a long time, and to this day nobody has developed an ethical way of combating it. 

that said, according to [this report](http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub1167.pdf), the use of drones has correlated with a decrease of insurgent activity.

russians won't do that, though. you don't need forward fire observers to target entire platoons, columns of tanks, bunkers, sams, and radar installations. any satellite recon will work, because that equipment is really easy to see.

remember, a lot of the us military's equipment was *designed* to kill russian equipment and outwit russian tactics. we've spent the last 70 years specifically forming doctrine to destroy the russian military. everything the russians developed, we counter-developed. 

and it wouldn't be fair to say that the russians haven't done the same with our doctrine. *but!* the russians are twenty years behind. following the collapse of the ussr and the subsequent turmoil, the russians stopped military r&amp;d. they simply couldn't afford to update their military to keep pace with ours. it hasn't been until the past few years that they've even started getting that part of their industry back. for example, russia has only 2,000 of their most modern mbt, while the us has 9,000+.

and lastly, throw in the fact that russia has few allies that would actually be both capable and willing to back them up in a shit-storm. if the us invades, it's going to have both it's might, plus the combined strength of nato nations, and maybe even some ex-warsaw bloc countries who hold grudges. 

china ain't gonna help. kazakhstan doesn't have anything they could reasonably use to help. the ukraine sure as fuck isn't going to be there. syria is in no position to help, as is cuba and libya. iran *might* do something. 

yeah, they've got cold weather, but this isn't wwii. the us' supply lines make nazi germany's look like a model train stuffed full of cheese and crackers. 

russia is two steps behind the us with doctrine, has no allies, little practice, an aging arsenal of equipment, and an incredibly weak economy. how, *exactly*, is the russian military going to stand up to the us military?vitek 2012, here. 

shit still gives me flashbacks. &gt; consider the troubles the us had in iraq and afganistan?

you mean the trouble telling the difference between insurgents and civilians? the reason why the us struggled is because it was very hard to wage a war where you can't even tell who your enemy is. this isn't a problem the americans would suffer from when fighting russia, which has a uniformed, standing army.

you may also want to read up on how quickly we decimated the standing iraqi military. and take a look at casualties for both the us and insurgents. 

to say the us struggled because they're ineffective fighters is foolish.

&gt; then consider that russia has modern technology at its disposal 

"modern". formidable, yes, modern, not in any significant numbers. almost all of the equipment the us currently uses was designed to be used against the soviets, and has the benefit of 20 years of additional improvement. 

russian equipment is almost entirely soviet-era hardware that has only recently been modernized, and only partially. and the russians don't have the same amount of experience the americans have at fighting war. we've been in conflict for close to 15 years; our supply lines, support, triage, and doctrine reflects that.

&gt; along with mandatory conscription for all men in russia at 18 meaning every man in russia has been trained for military service to some degree.

number of troops means jack-shit. the reason why the us stopped conscripting troops is because vietnam showed us it just doesn't work. a volunteer military benefits from the fact that every soldier present *wants* to be there, and has been selected. the unfit are rejected.

&gt; then factor in the russian winter that reaches minus 40 degrees which they are more than used to.

what makes you think we'd send ground troops when our absurdly large supply of cruise missiles, icbms, and bombers would do the job just as well? 

&gt; it would be like vietnam the death toll for the us would be so immense the american public would demand a withdrawal sooner or later.

if the us is going to war with russia, something *very*, **very** bad has happened. i'm talking "russia nukes poland" type bad. anything that would actually get the us to invade russia is going to give the us the benefit of strong public support.the us has the benefit of having a large standing army that actually has experience with their equipment. regardless of who they're shooting at, they've had plenty of practice actually fighting.

and it's not like russia has experience fighting regular armies recently, either. the most experience they've got for sure is chechnya.the half-life timeline is very useful:

http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/timeline

[portal itself takes place after the resonance cascade and seven hour war.](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/aperture_science_enrichment_center#portal_era) i believe there were cut references to how glados was doing her best to keep *"them"* out, but i can't verify it. 

edit: actually i can. via the half-life wiki:

&gt; throughout the fight, glados becomes increasingly distressed and enraged as her mental functions deteriorate, shouting insults and mockery at chell. she insists that chell would be better off simply allowing glados to kill her, making a vague allusion to the combine invasion.

[portal 2 is supposed to take place sometime between a few hundred](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/aperture_science_enrichment_center#portal_2_era) and 10,000 years in the future, as detailed in "the final hours of portal 2". you also hear this similarly echoed by the announcer at the beginning of portal 2, who glitches when stating the amount of time chell has spent in the vault. 

this was intentionally done to keep the events of portal 2 and half-life 2/3 from interfering with each other, and to provide a simple answer as to why there's no combine/civilization on the surface after chell finally escapes. 

additionally, the aperture science enrichment center is located in [upper michigan](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/aperture_science_enrichment_center). 

sorry to shoot holes in your theories, but they don't fly. he's not looking at cs employment, he's erroneously looking at in-cs employment rate. 

cs has a *lot* of skills that are applicable in other fields. a long time ago, yeah. i got 11k gems just by recycling the crap i already had in my inventory.

managed to convert the entire thing of backgrounds and emoticons into about $12 worth of gems, which i put towards getting the walking dead: season 2.

pretty good deal, if i do say so myself."i know you've been... complaining"

lol. boiler up. 

or in this case, down to the ground. no kidding. i'm a sucker for atomic-age looking stuff, and this is straight up my alley. except one of the major problems with the term "ai" right now is that we don't even have a working definition or quantification of what "intelligence" is in the first place.

pretty damn hard to make a "strong ai" if you can't even define it, much less its root concepts.iq != intelligence. 

&gt; haha, i don't need to do anything.

i wasn't asking you to. "you" was a reference to society as a whole. 

&gt; the mechanisms of schizophrenia are not as defined as you make them out to be and are still changing in academic discourse to this day. the whole site you linked to even shows the varying hypothesis regarding what schizophrenia is, also how "schizophrenia" has been treated in a variety of different environments and cultures. psychological "disorders" are not as black and white as you seem to think they are.

my whole point was just that. the reasons we diagnose what we diagnose hinge on more than what "society" deems normal. foucault seems to be implying otherwise, suggesting that society dictates what is and isn't normal, and psychology follows their lead. 

&gt; the "condition" is still a intensely debated topic by professors at many highly distinguished educational institutions.

[no](http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/f20), [actually](http://www.icd9data.com/2014/volume1/290-319/295-299/295/default.htm), [it](http://omim.org/entry/181500) [is](http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/schizophrenia-pro) [not](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2014/mb_cgi?mode=&amp;term=schizophrenia&amp;field=entry). schizophrenia is not a debated topic, the exact cause is. the symptoms, rate of occurrence, and hereditary nature are pretty well defined. 

&gt; sometimes lines aren't simply drawn in the sand, and even if they are, the wind can just as easily blow them away.

and sometimes lines are carved in stone. the bigger issue is whether or not people can tell the difference. at some point you just need to shut the hell up and draw a line somewhere. there's a reason why we have things like the [dsm-5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dsm-5), which defines different mental disorders and their suggested treatment. 

a disease that affects 1.1% of the adult population *is not normal*. not only that, we *know* the [mechanisms of schizophrenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mechanisms_of_schizophrenia) to the point that it's not just based off of your couch time in a psychiatrist's office. absolutely they can. it's their service, they can do as they please and they don't need to justify it.

conversely, you're more than within your right to complain about it. if an art gallery refused to sell abject art focused on female menstruation, would the people who are upset about steam pulling hatred be upset about it?and unless you're holding a bachelors in psychology, you are likely poorly equipped to fairly vet foucault's work. 

&gt; psychiatry is no different of a control mechanism in society.

and that is hardly different from believing vaccines cause autism. then be aware that schizophrenia has a strong hereditary component.sometimes i wonder what it's like being scared of literally everything. 

how is it?hey, look! /r/panichistory i was a part of!

i think the reason why reddit loves 1984 so much is because a sad pudgy guy is approached by a somewhat attractive woman who propositions him for sex so they can be rebels together.good thing there's been perpetual war worldwide since the beginning of time, then.nothing. i don't think anything is going to happen. 

that'd be like expecting republicans to cut medicare/medicaid. on paper, you'd think they'd *want* to, but realistically, they're smart enough to understand that being warhawks after 11 years of war is just going to get their asses thrown out.&gt; does the "war on terror" not sound like a never ending war to you?

no, it doesn't, because we're ramping down. the us is sick of fighting, and it's pretty obvious, too. the fact that we were so uninvolved in both libya and syria speaks volumes to this, and the almost universal reluctance to re-engage in iraq is another indicator of just how sick of it we are.

the "war on communism" ended, so too shall the "war on terror". aaaand bookmarked. the major difference between games and movies/tv/books is that the viewer (in this case player) has the ability to explore the world independently from the player's specific story. 

some worlds forego the player's story altogether, and focus on the story told by the world (dear esther, myst). 

the reason why people are upset with you over fallout is that there's actually a ton of story knitted into the game's setting. all of the vaults tell a story, every dead raider, every burnt building, every abandoned car. finding a skeleton clutching a stuffed bear in a powalski fallout shelter is a sad, one-byte story with a broad implication.

in my opinion, sometimes the smallest, most inconsequential details do more to build a story than any plot. 

in film/theater/literature, i would agree with the point you're trying to make. but not in games.i disagree as well. a good setting isn't just a vehicle for a story, it's a story within itself. writing on walls, corpses clutching bears in dime fallout shelters, protest signs outside of the vaults...

the world as a whole has hundreds of thousands of stories to tell. the plot of a game is merely one of them. ok, that much i get and agree with. uh... yeah no i'm still not following.

there's a whole mess of economic and societal problems involved with race in the us and sa, and i'm still not making the connection between the two and 1984. i agree with your first sentence, but then lost you. 

what exactly did the us and south africa do? i think they read 1984, but they spent all of their time masturbating to the sex scenes with winston and julia. brave new world is still pretty far off. i think farenheit 451 would probably be the closest thing i've seen to a modern critique of society, but like you said about bnw, it's a stretch.

i think that's the thing people fail to grasp: you can draw parallels all you want, and many of them may be accurate and valid, but at the end of the day it's still incredibly hard to directly compare the novel to reality. get us to what point? the president has abysmal ratings and congress is even worse. the amount of animosity shown to the police in the us is probably at an all time high, and don't get me started on the public's perception of corporate america.

we're about as far as we could possibly be from thinking the powers that be are wonderful. yeah, dunno who that /u/slukaj guy is. &gt; personally, i love the book because it's also a personal story of a man who is isolated from the rest of the world. there is, i think, an undervalued character story within the political narrative, which is also timeless.

i agree, the story of winston was actually more interesting to me than the whole surveillance aspect of the story.

i also believe it's part of why so many people on reddit love 1984. lonely, overweight guy is suddenly contacted by a beautiful woman who wants to have sex with him to fight the man? i wonder why internet commentors love it...

&gt;  these days, i look at 1984 as a cautionary tale, and much like the declaration of independence, it's more of a guiding political work, to me, but it isn't a solid, binding manifesto.

that's the way to do it. and you've got to read more than one book, too. i know brave new world and fahrenheit 451 get tossed around a lot, too. but, oddly enough, you never see any cautionary tales about things redditors find near and dear... pretty much everything i've just described would be a bare minimum.yep. i am.

because in the long run, we're just going to remember the nsa the same way we remembered mccarthy and hoover: a minor part of the overall history of our world that most people are just going to forget anyway. til i am billpikai do. which is also how you can tell we're not in 1984 or anywhere close to it.

if it were 1984, the news'd portray the government as a bastion of peace, happiness, and efficiency. you'd never hear about cops shooting innocents, or inward-facing spy programs, or government corruption. yep. though i believe it wise to remember points of history such as the mccarthy trials and hoover's desire to gather tons of information on people in the early days of the fbi.

inward facing spy programs don't exist because the government is evil and out to get you. it exists because it's become so easy to gather that information that you'd almost have to be stupid not to do so. *thank you*. 

1984 was written as a literary critique of society that employed gross exaggerations of real concerns so that the lay-person could easily understand them. the roots of 1984's concepts are all very real concerns in today's society in much the same way a brave new world and farenheit 451's concerns are real. 

but people seem to have taken 1984 and hyped it up to the point that they believe it's a tale predicting the future of an advanced society. then, they use that same lack of ability to understand subtlety and apply it to the real world and freak themselves out over mraps and prism. 

it's amazing that 1984 has had the ability to make so many people immediately kneejerk their opinions into overdrive without actually reading beyond a headline.no, i just read the book. one of the big things you learn if you take computer science courses in college is that a lot of what a computer does is actually very simple math done very fast. 

for example, handwriting recognition can basically be modeled using linear algebra (vectors and matrices). an individual 100 years ago could follow the same steps and produce a usable result, but would take a year to do so. a computer can do the same thing in a matter of seconds. 

computers are literally just machines that compute. they do math, and they do it very fast. this. this is what happens when you make a book standard reading material for hundreds of thousands of high school students.

&gt; "there is only one possible interpretation of this book, and it is clearly the interpretation my teacher taught me. there is absolutely no room for disagreement, and all rational discussion between varying views is literally the work of the devil."

don't make orwell out to be some prophet. he was just a man like huxley, you, or i. he had no better idea of how our world would turn out than anyone else at the time, much the same way you and i have equally poor ideas of how our future will turn out. what?yes, because orwell himself said that 1984 was a retrospective critique of society at the time disguised as a futuristic sci-fi. 

1984 was written as a literary critique of society in 1948. the book is no more relevant now than it was then. no, it's for recreational use, too. 

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/29/justice-medical-marijuana-laws/2727605/and while it's true surveillance has an effect on behavior, it does not have the effect that 1984 suggested. nowhere close.

littering is an incredibly inconsequential way to test this hypothesis. it doesn't bother the normal person to carry their trash to a trashcan.which is, in itself, a vaguely 1984 comment. it is known that oceania is always at war with east asia. 

whether or not something is "already known" is irrelevant, because by your own beliefs, that which is "already known" has been fed to you by the government, because everyone knows that oceania has always been at war with eurasia.

at some point you just have to step back and let your mind boggle at how much work actually goes into pulling something like that off.  yes but if you make caveats about the degree of how relevant something is, you can make any literary critique of society fit any aspect of society. 

&gt;  snowden gave source information.

snowden gave information he felt was relevant. how can you be certain he didn't leak an operations manual but failed to leak the companion manual detailing the checks and balances? 

the documents he leaked were pretty damning, but *greenwald is the one who is choosing which documents to leak*. greenwald is a man with an axe to grind through and through, and the final decision to omit potentially relevant information rests squarely on *his* shoulders. do you think greenwald would release a document that shows the us doing something *good*?

&gt; neither do the people in 1984.

you need to go reread 1984. if the main character so much as sneezed, someone would contact him via the speaker in his camera. 

&gt; when people are watched, they behave differently.

bullshit. internet history says otherwise. 

&gt; it's about government forcing you to behave like they want by its omnipresence.

and they're apparently doing a great fucking job aren't they? still nowhere close to 1984. 

in orwell's 1984, you'd be dead for writing this comment. &gt; still illegal at the federal level.

but the federal level explicitly stated that they will not impede on state's decision to legalize it. a few more states, and the federal level will just go ahead and legalize it.

&gt; also, you've conveniently ignored anything about us-sponsored torture.

you mean the us-sponsored torture that was detailed in a very comprehensive and condemning report written by the us federal government? 

the very fact that the government is officially recognizing it is absolutely unheard of. &gt; massive uncontrolled and accountable surveillance

according to two guys who have no accountability themselves. seriously, who's vetted edward snowden or glenn greenwald to ensure they're giving you fair and unbiased information? 

and then let's talk about torture in guantanamo. how did the truth come out? a fucking government-led investigation. "no accountability" my ass. not enough, ok, but non-existent is a bold-faced lie. 

&gt; controlled media

what the fuck does this even mean? who's controlling the media? what media? which outlets? are they controlling all media and every outlet? just fox news? just nbc? just cnn?

i can aggregate my news from the bbc, npr, and forbes and have a reasonably decent expectation that my news is fair. if you watch just one news source, you're an idiot.

&gt; conglomerate sponsored politicians

yes, this one *is* actually concerning. but that's not something 1984 foretold. 

&gt;  law enforcement with little accountability

again, somewhat concerning. but i again refer to my comment about guantanamo. not enough accountability, sure, but non-existent is horseshit.

&gt; secret courts and courts that are just there for show

again, concerning, but 99.99% of all people will never feel the affect of these courts. it's not orwellian. 

&gt; wars that never end

i'm fairly certain the iraq war is over. and vietnam. and we're not involved in syria or libya. and operations in afghanistan are winding down. hardly "never ending war".

oh gosh, i'm just so oppressed by the metal detector/back scatter machines at airport. it's literally the biggest affront to my freedom possible! the humanity!

&gt; walking around in nyc without being searched and frisked.

i'll admit, i'm not a new yorker. but i've had no problems with cops in any other city i've walked around in. hell, i drunkenly wandered around downtown seattle at 1am and passed two cops with nary a nod of the head.

&gt; not being thrown in jail for personal amounts of barely dangerous drugs.

that one i'll agree to. thank god there's this new-fangled system called "democracy" that has enabled two states in the union to fully legalize cannabis. &gt; we are under the illusion of freedom.

are we? exactly what were we allowed to do when we had "real freedom" that we cannot do now? 

&gt; but they do not act unless you do something.

how is that any different from 100 years ago?

&gt; this is to prevent mass hysteria and up-rising.

what?

&gt; 1984 is very much alive just in a different way.

no, it's not. the world is just as uncontrolled and chaotic as it was at any other point in history. no, you're right, we were just teaching kids to be terrified of the fucking sky.

the fact that you can say that means that it hasn't even come close to doing so. a childish oversimplification?

*they're fucking children.* this is the only time a childish simplification actually makes sense. anything you're interested in. find something you want to build and build it!

this is by no means a piece of weaponry.

[the mole](http://thunderbirds.wikia.com/wiki/the_mole), like every other piece of [international rescue hardware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thunderbirds_machines), is designed for *rescue purposes only*. the empire of japan?england?the take off wobble makes me think rc model. the fact that such a high ratio of people found that review helpful...yeah it was *way* too nintendo heavy, but this is the closest they've ever gotten to making a half-way decent awards show for games. 

the fact that they recognized the founders of sierra and not, say, anita sarkeesian or totalbiscuit speaks volumes for how hard they're trying to treat the medium as a respectable thing. hm. that's a bit disturbing, honestly. got a source for that? &gt; gallium 3

holy fucking shit that's hilarious.who was originally designed to not care about *either* side of this shitstorm, and just wanted to play games.

the cia wouldn't exist if it were bad at its job. you only hear about the things that go wrong, because if everything went right, nobody would have found out about it. 

kinda the point of a clandestine organization.yeah, don't go looking for any more art by him if you're not expecting some seriously fetishized porn. update the graphics driver.you have to be pretty secure to watch mlp unironically. the franchises exist within the same universe.

black mesa and aperture were competitors competing for darpa grants. portal takes place some time after half-life, and portal 2 a *long* time after half-life 2.

137 get. yes, but the entire purpose of dc not being a state is so that no one state has the advantage of having the entire federal government in their pocket. dc, as dictated by the constitution, is solely under the control of the us federal government, specifically congress. 

heck, even with the [district of columbia home rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/district_of_columbia_home_rule), congress gets the right to overturn whatever law put in place by the local municipal governments. is it controversial? absolutely. but that's the way the laws are right now.

washington dc is federal territory. the will of the us *as a whole* dictates what can and cannot happen within that area. 

&gt; ...and don't feed me a line about "oh, move to virginia!"

why? because dc isn't 63 square miles? the *entire point* of the district's existence is to service the federal government. 

i agree, it's a really stupid retort, but holy shit is dc tiny. pick *any* direction and move 10 miles and you'd be out of the district.which is sort of my point. dc doesn't get to self-determine because the whole reason why dc even exists is so that no one state gets the advantage of housing the federal government. because dc is federal land, not state land, and it's that way by design. dc is all around a weird zone politically. though i don't know how dc voted.you mean the voters who overwhelmingly voted for a conservative republican congress?

sounds like congress is actually paying attention. "ok" is a 3.0 - 3.5 in my mind. do you know how many people can get that as a gpa? a *lot* of them. thus, the minimum threshold for a lot of scholarships is now greater than 3.5. a lot of those scholarships aren't available if you're a white, middle class person with ok grades, though. grow up. you don't get to trash another group's subreddit and then pull a "don't take it seriously, hurr hurr". 

this is like the ferguson riots of video games. not enough to offset the cost of college. not quite the same specs. coding is literally the hardest thing? what?

bad choice of words aside, coding is the *easy* part. it's the "knowing how to use a hammer" of mechanical engineering or the "how to operate an electron microscope" of biology. 

it's simple. figuring out how to do something with it is hard. figuring out how to do something efficiently is even harder.nor have you.out of mild curiosity... how would valve curating the store be any different from any other old boys network? 

because i'm willing to bet your entire answer is "valve is cool, they would be fair". i was in /r/antipozi and some how confused myself into thinking that it was /r/subredditdrama. 

holy fuck was it a relief to find that i wasn't where i thought i was."i have one piece of anecdotal evidence, therefore i am completely equipped to make a brief generalization."if you're interested in that...

try to see if you can track down this collection. 142 songs of cold war wonder. this is exactly what i did for my multi-monitor setup. 

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/martian-sunset-o-de-goursac-curiosity-2013.jpgi actually had the opportunity to fire a modern m1911a1 (ria) for the first time yesterday.

it's amazing to me that a 103 year old design is still so comfortable and straightforward to use. it compares very well to more modern designs (i found it preferable to a friend's m&amp;p shield). of course you can. and it's a very real problem.

but it looks like we've still got more time before those bubbles pop than the chinese do. if you ignore the numerous bubbles in the chinese economy that are on the cusp of collapsing, sure. well that's because our field suffers from schizophrenia. ask 10 computer scientists what we are and you'll get at least 4 answers (scientists, mathematicians, engineers, wizards). &gt; you're learning a trade.

heh. 

joking aside, there's a reason why ph.d stands for doctor of philosophy. science and mathematics are both, simply, applied philosophy (to a point). 

&gt; a marketable skill.

no, that's *engineering*. marketable physics is mechanical/aerospace engineering. marketable chemistry is chemical/material engineering. marketable computer science is software/computer engineering. etc etc etc. same with computer science and mathematics.very common thing to do. not much different from learning how to use any other tool if you've got the right resources. i *knew* it!http://www.buckbokai.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/butterfly-derby-costume-cropped.jpg

i've also noted that the alien also starts to sort of favor particular regions of the station, typically the region you're standing in. i sort of suspect that the alien's position is limited to some radius surrounding the player, and it cannot travel beyond that circle. 

i'd like to try seeing if i can train the thing to ignore sound grenades and flares. unfortunately, though, i don't have that many of each. i don't take my laptop to class. too much of a distraction.

i use my desktop for 90% of my school work, and my laptop fills in whenever i need to do school work elsewhere. yes, xbl seems to be down for me, too.

can't play the mcc, which is super cool. 

edit: apparently some group of virgins called "lizard patrol" knocked xbl out?

https://twitter.com/lizardpatrolit's an absolutely gorgeous piece of engineering. the mechanism actually does (from what i've read) a great job at mitigating the recoil of the first shot while cycling the second. the two-burst concept actually works.

but it's also incredibly expensive to build, and very time consuming to maintain. i believe it was supposed to be reserved for special forces exclusively, but i don't even think it caught on with them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zy31_jol7c

one of the few times the russians threw the "simple is better" ideal out the window.the plastic bulk houses the pulley system that is used during the weapon's action.down in front!it's not the cities, it's rural america. 

my parents pay for 8 mbps and get 1 mbps. i've called the provider multiple times and their reason is basically "sorry, they live out in the boondocks. can't help em.", even though we live about 20 minutes from downtown indianapolis without traffic. i shudder to think about people who live further out.it's definitely an improvement over the gen-ii kit, but i'll never love another mjolnir as much as i love the mk.v's. 

the mk.v actually *looked* military. the angled nature of the plates in the chest, groin, and legs reminded me of the design of a tank, which is basically what the suit was supposed to be. ok, so then if i call iran an arab, desert nation, you won't care because i'm a westerner?i've always heard that black friday was when store sales went from being in the red to being in the black. basically going from almost profitable to profitable.fuck, dude, the fact that these suits are real and not just cgi is probably the best thing that's happened today.to a point, but it throws out so much nuance and situational awareness that it may as well be a conspiracy theory.i'm confused, is this not the bitcoin media sphere?

i don't see this stuff talked about at all outside of /r/bitcoin. /u/dierubikdie basically nailed it, but telltale makes games that are best described as an amalgam of "choose your own adventure" books and comics. &gt; but is there evidence that this is being noticed outside of the bitcoin media sphere?

no.

source: don't follow bitcoin at all (here from /r/all).funny... if i so much as drop a foot in a bt-7 in war thunder, the whole crew bang their heads on the inside of the hull and knock themselves out. ano, fukushima shows what happens when you put back up diesel generators at an unsafe height. i'm about as pro-nuke as you can get, and i'm not foolish enough to call it the world's cleanest energy source. that realization is sort of the closest thing i can think of to an "oh my god i'm an adult" thought. 

enjoy it.not that i've noticed. occasionally you get a glimpse of an idea like that, but the reality is that it doesn't feel any different.the liberal view during the 1960's and 1970's was that the vietnam war was a terrible thing, and that the us should keep its nose out of the rest of the world's affairs.

forty years later, we're in the 13th year of the longest conflict the us has ever seen, and it's basically because we stuck our nose in the rest of the world's affairs. what do you think happened to all of the people from the 1960's and 1970's?

no, and i see weed the same way i see alcohol.

if you use it enough that it has a negative effect on your life, you have a problem and need to cut back. let's put it this way:

you're paying to go to school. you're *paying* for it.

too much partying is when you start wasting your money because your ability to perform in school suffers. first challenge: realize that "the friendzone" doesn't exist outside of your own head.

if you ask a girl out and she says something to the effect of "i only see you as a friend", buck up and move on. she doesn't owe you, and you're not going to get anything done by dwelling on it.

there's nothing wrong with cutting contact with people who reject you, as long as you're not an asshole about it. hell no. &gt; how do you get yourself to follow your dreams?

that's a solid question that i don't have an answer to. my perspective is that i follow my dreams because they're my dreams, but that may just be because i'm lucky.

&gt; also, when do you realized your dreams are too far fetched and start to form a backup plan?

you don't, really. what mostly happens is that your plans sort of change over time based on what you learn as you age. 

for example, i went to college to pursue a bs in computer science so i could make video games. over time, as i learned more about my field, my dream sort of shifted away from video games and towards machine learning and ai, and at this point my dream is to develop solutions for game developers that make heavy use of ml and ai concepts. 

your dreams never die, they just grow up alongside you. the people who get hit with regrets are the ones that didn't let their dreams change naturally with age and knowledge. no. i don't like not being in control of my mind. big lesson of growing up:

if someone is offering you advice (which is in essence what teaching is), **listen**. part of what made us as a species successful is that we're able to listen to the mistakes of others so that we might not make the same ones again.kick the drug habit for good. seriously don't do drugs anymore.

once your mind sorts itself back out, some of the mistakes you might not have noticed you made will become clear, and you can actually try to fix them. here's what i learned sometime in high school:

*the only true failure is failing to try your hardest.*

the only way you learn is by trying and failing. if you don't try, you don't learn, even if you succeed. keep doing what you love but start trying a little bit of everything. practice painting, learn to program, weld some shit together, make a piece of furniture, study math, whatever.

if you don't feel passionate about something, that's simply because there's a lot of stuff to do in this world, and nobody has tried them all. just do everything and you'll figure it out.

if you find that your only passions are skating and surfing, then do that. open a skate/surf shop or write a blog about it. but always try to expand your horizons; you'll never know what you find interesting until you try it. transition?

i'd say the point you realize you're an adult is when you look at everyone around you and realize that there was no transition. at the end of the day, your average person is nothing more than a child with responsibilities. people think you're an idiot at any age. it has nothing to do with you being a teenager and everything to do with the fact that humans are idiots.i want to throw a thought out there that i think few people ever mention:

steam isn't going anywhere. *maybe* valve is, but steam isn't. and let's face it: it's *by a solid margin* the largest content management service for video games *ever*. 

here's why:

1) steam is kept afloat by the fees levied on producers and developers. steam isn't funded by valve, and it's almost certainly providing valve with some form of profit.

*many* developers would be interested in keeping steam alive and healty. if steam goes tits-up, hundreds if not thousands of developers will take a massive hit. it helps developers and producers to keep steam alive just as much as it helps valve.

2) from a user perspective, steam is safe because steam is where the majority keeps their library. origin is a great service, often better than steam, but until origin lets me transfer my entire steam library to origin, i'll stick with steam.

to get the public to move, you'd need to offer a service that offers better service than steam *and* the ability to transfer my steam purchases to the new service. and the second point is really key: you could offer me a service where someone gives me the best blowjob of my life every time i play a game using their service, and i'd *still* not switch if it meant losing my steam library.

the library is *key* to steam's continued success from the user standpoint. you might not understand satire.btfuthat's hindsight, formed by surveys taken after the conclusion of the war.

how, exactly, would the us military command have known that information?yes, 1.95 seconds *is* a long time. hell, back in the days of quake 3,it was fairly easy to achieve an "excellent" (two kills in two seconds) without using a splash damage weapon.

i could kill two or three guys with the eva-8 in the time it takes for the smart pistol to lock on to one (without the advanced targeting). ok, mr. armchair general, come up with some alternatives. you've been tasked with ensuring the absolute surrender of the japanese, how do you do it without an invasion or the atomic bomb?

wwii played host to some of the best military leaders in history, and you're just going to say that "obviously they didn't come up with enough solutions"?1.95 seconds is a *long* time to be unaware of someone shooting you, especially in a game as fast paced as titanfall. 

a half decent player could get a bead on you with the r101 in half that time. &gt; the world has been very, very close to world war 3, as well as other uses of nuclear weapons, so it's only luck that stops us from actually discussing it now.

no, not luck. every time it's because someone with a level head said something. every single time we've ever come close to the brink, rationality prevailed. 

&gt; we know better and we're not under the same pressure.

exactly, and it's not like we've been lobbing nukes at each other for the past 70 years. we *learned*.

&gt; that shouldn't be that nukes are an acceptable option.

when weighed against the human and material cost of the alternative?i, too, remember the apocalyptic nuclear inferno that was wwiii.

what, exactly, do you mean by "the refusal to learn anything from it now that we don't have to use the war's insane logic"?
